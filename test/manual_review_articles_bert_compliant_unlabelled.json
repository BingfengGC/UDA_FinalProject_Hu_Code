Meanwhile, the U.K. has sold part of its Lloyds Banking Group Plc holding at a profit.\n\u201cThe right thing to do for the economy and for taxpayers is to start selling off our stake,\u201d Osborne said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThis is an important first step in returning the bank to private ownership.\u201d\nThe money raised from the sale will be used to pay down the national debt, the Treasury said in the statement.\nThe stock is below the 407 pence at which the government says it would break even on its 45.5 billion-pound rescue. The Treasury published a report by Rothschild in June that said the government would make money from the sum of its total bank bailout program -- even if it makes a loss on RBS. Rothschild acted as capital markets adviser on Monday\u2019s sale.\nCitigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and UBS Group AG managed the offering.","token_count":388},{"organizations":[],"uuid":"f69e07ff8c0fca74e2fd048dce2dcbe9a746257d","author":"Reuters","url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/07\/14\/amazon-iberdrola-idUSL5N0ZU27920150714","ord_in_thread":0,"title":"CORRECTED-Spain's Iberdrola to build 208 MW U.S. wind farm for Amazon","locations":[],"highlightText":"","language":"english","persons":[],"text":"(Corrects first paragraph to show location is North Carolina, not South Carolina)\nMADRID, July 14 (Reuters) - Online store Amazon has contracted Spanish utility Iberdrola to build and manage a 208 megawatt wind farm in North Carolina, United States, the U.S. company said in a statement.\nAmazon affiliate Amazon Web Services (AWS) said on Monday the wind farm would be operational by December of next year.\n(Reporting by Jose Elias Rodriguez; Writing by Paul Day, editing by John Stonestreet)","external_links":[],"published":"2015-07-14T16:47:00.000+03:00","crawled":"2015-07-14T15:59:16.000+03:00","highlightTitle":"","thread_social_gplus_shares":0,"thread_social_pinterest_shares":0,"thread_social_vk_shares":0,"thread_social_linkedin_shares":0,"thread_social_facebook_likes":0,"thread_social_facebook_shares":0,"thread_social_facebook_comments":0,"thread_social_stumbledupon_shares":0,"thread_site_full":"www.reuters.com","thread_main_image":"","thread_site_section":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/finance\/personal-finance","thread_section_title":"Wealth, Personal Finance &amp; Money | Reuters.com","thread_url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/07\/14\/amazon-iberdrola-idUSL5N0ZU27920150714","thread_country":"US","thread_title":"CORRECTED-Spain's Iberdrola to build 208 MW U.S. wind farm for Amazon","thread_performance_score":0,"thread_site":"reuters.com","thread_participants_count":1,"thread_title_full":"CORRECTED-Spain's Iberdrola to build 208 MW U.S. wind farm for Amazon | Reuters","thread_spam_score":0,"thread_site_type":"news","thread_published":"2015-07-14T16:47:00.000+03:00","thread_replies_count":0,"thread_uuid":"f69e07ff8c0fca74e2fd048dce2dcbe9a746257d","entities_persons":[],"entities_locations":[],"entities_organizations":[],"word_count":90,"text_full":"CORRECTED-Spain's Iberdrola to build 208 MW U.S. wind farm for Amazon\n(Corrects first paragraph to show location is North Carolina, not South Carolina)\nMADRID, July 14 (Reuters) - Online store Amazon has contracted Spanish utility Iberdrola to build and manage a 208 megawatt wind farm in North Carolina, United States, the U.S. company said in a statement.\nAmazon affiliate Amazon Web Services (AWS) said on Monday the wind farm would be operational by December of next year.\n(Reporting by Jose Elias Rodriguez; Writing by Paul Day, editing by John Stonestreet)","token_count":130},{"organizations":[],"uuid":"ad854bab89da16cb6406fde0ac4062a000578789","author":"Reuters","url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/10\/16\/japan-bonds-idUSL3N12G21920151016","ord_in_thread":0,"title":"JGBs little changed, traders look to Kuroda","locations":[],"highlightText":"","language":"english","persons":[],"text":"TOKYO Oct 16 Japanese government bond prices were little changed on Friday, with market players looking to Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's comments later in the day for clues on whether the central bank will ease monetary policy later this month.\nThe yield on the current 10-year JGBs stood flat at 0.315 percent while the price of 10-year JGB futures were up 0.03 point at 148.35.\nKuroda will address bankers at 0635 GMT, amid mounting expectations that the BOJ may adopt stimulus at its next policy meeting on Oct. 30.\nAn auction of reopened bonds with five to 15 years to maturity produced fair results, underpinning the market.\nAt the shorter end of the market, the government's auction of one-year discount bills produced a high yield of minus 0.0358 percent, the lowest ever for the paper, reflecting shortage of short-term government bills.

( 1.usa.gov\/1LYRk4e )\nSeagate, which has about 52,200 employees worldwide, expects to complete the restructuring by the end of the December quarter.

The country is Africa\u2019s largest producer of crude, which accounts for about 90 percent of total exports and two-thirds of government revenue.

His exit from Greenhill, where he oversaw tech, media and communications banking, set off promotions to fill his role at that firm this week. Kamo will run a new sell-side M&A group for Credit Suisse starting in October, according to a separate memo.\nRankin and Weinberger, who joined Credit Suisse in the 1990s, became global co-heads of dealmaking in March and are now making additional changes.

The FTSE 250 listed company released a first half trading update on Thursday, with first half revenues 10% ahead from the previous year, sales up 7% and the outlook for further growth was looking positive. \nThe Telegraph's Questor said that while a sharp fall in pig prices had hit the company, demand from households suffering a financial squeeze has increased. With pork being a staple protein source for Europe, it drives steady demand. \nOn the business side, it said Cranswick's track record is excellent and has a strong balance sheet. Questor also noted the above inflation dividend increase make it worth holding the shares for the long term. \nBut The Times' Tempus has gone off the taste of pork and thinks the shares should be avoided for now. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said Cranswick's focus is to increase exports to China and finding more acquisitions, funded by the strong balance sheet. With the shares at 16 times earnings, Tempus said it looks a bit too high despite the outlook. \nTempus also had some thoughts on Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) , recommending it's a good time to buy shares in the catalytic converter company.

The FTSE 250 listed company released a first half trading update on Thursday, with first half revenues 10% ahead from the previous year, sales up 7% and the outlook for further growth was looking positive. \nThe Telegraph's Questor said that while a sharp fall in pig prices had hit the company, demand from households suffering a financial squeeze has increased. With pork being a staple protein source for Europe, it drives steady demand. \nOn the business side, it said Cranswick's track record is excellent and has a strong balance sheet. Questor also noted the above inflation dividend increase make it worth holding the shares for the long term. \nBut The Times' Tempus has gone off the taste of pork and thinks the shares should be avoided for now. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said Cranswick's focus is to increase exports to China and finding more acquisitions, funded by the strong balance sheet. With the shares at 16 times earnings, Tempus said it looks a bit too high despite the outlook. \nTempus also had some thoughts on Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) , recommending it's a good time to buy shares in the catalytic converter company.

U.S. coffee and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme said in May it will open 31 stores in South Africa within five years. \nInvestors are often drawn to South African companies who can offer a gateway into faster-growing economies elsewhere on the continent. \n\"It's quite a big market in South Africa.

U.S. coffee and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme said in May it will open 31 stores in South Africa within five years. \nInvestors are often drawn to South African companies who can offer a gateway into faster-growing economies elsewhere on the continent. \n\"It's quite a big market in South Africa. We have got established players with lots of experience,\" said Wayne McCurrie, portfolio manager at Momentum Wealth. \n\"Maybe more importantly, if Africa shows the growth potential over the next decade that everyone expects, then this is a good base to start from,\" McCurrie added. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Taste hit a record high in the session and were up 19.9 percent at 5 rand per share, more than 56 percent year-to-date.

ANZ\u2019s holdings in the Jakarta-based lender are worth about 8.88 trillion rupiah ($614 million) based on the current share price, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nANZ is seeking to sell the Bank Panin stake after Australian regulators introduced rules in 2013 requiring banks to subtract the entire value of overseas minority investments from Tier 1 capital.
