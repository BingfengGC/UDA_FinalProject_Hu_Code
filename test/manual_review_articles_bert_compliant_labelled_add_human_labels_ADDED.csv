Europe's stock markets fell by more than one percent at the open on Wednesday despite gains in Asia, as investor enthusiasm waned over China's interest rate cut. 
In initial trade, London's benchmark FTSE 100 index lost 1.30 percent to 6,002.28 points, Frankfurt's DAX 30 tumbled 1.69 percent to 9,956.85 and the CAC 40 in Paris sank 1.44 percent to 4,499.23 points. 
European markets had rebounded Tuesday after China cut interest rates in an attempt to boost the flagging Chinese economy, which had sent markets into a tailspin on Monday. 
Wall Street also rallied on the news but optimism soon fizzled and New York ended with sharp losses. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.29 percent as the market remained jittery over China after recent stock gyrations, especially Monday, when the Dow tumbled more than 1,000 points at one stage.

""It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's Wall Street's slump... that appears to be setting the pace for the UK market and, as is often the way after these excessive moves, this volatility appears likely to be with us for some time yet."" 
On the upside, Asian equities pushed higher Wednesday after China's rate cut -- aimed at soothing fears about stalling growth in the world's number-two economy -- but more volatility was forecast in a crisis that has panicked global markets. 
China's central bank reduced interest rates on Tuesday and slashed the amount of money banks need to hold in reserve -- its second such double move in two months -- in a bid to stimulate growth.

LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The man expected to win control of Britain's opposition Labour Party said on Thursday that he voted 'No' to Britain's membership of the forerunner to the European Union in a 1975 referendum.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices extended gains in Asia on Wednesday on an unexpected stockpile draw and higher gasoline prices, while international crude markets remained weak on the back of low growth expectations. 
Australian bank Macquarie said that China's economic outlook for the fourth quarter of the year was muted. 
""There are green shoots showing scattered evidence of improvement ... However, as of yet these signs are not broad-based so it's hard to conclude whether they are the beginning of a genuine recovery or just normal economic fluctuations,"" the bank said. 
The recent divergence in American and international markets has reduced the discount between U.S. and global crude benchmarks by almost two thirds during the past month to around $2.50 per barrel. 
U.S. crude futures rose after industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a 3.1 million-barrel crude drawdown last week, versus analyst expectations for a build. A surge in American gasoline prices was also supportive. 
Yet outside the United States, international crude markets were weaker largely because of high supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) clashing with slowing demand, especially in Asia. 
Front-month U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at $44.86 per barrel at 0300 GMT on Wednesday, up 27 cents from their last settlement. Internationally traded Brent futures were virtually unchanged from their last close, trading at $47.73 a barrel. 
Oil markets will be keeping a close eye on Washington policymakers in the next two days as the U.S. Fed begins a two-day session to decide whether it will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. 
Higher U.S. interest rates would likely attract cash from money traders, lifting the dollar. That would be seen as a bearish signal for oil as it makes fuel more expensive for importers who hold other currencies.

South Korea's dominant Samsung conglomerate -- run by the country's wealthiest family -- secured shareholder approval Friday for the merger of two affiliates, seeing off a formidable challenge from investor activists led by a combative US hedge fund. 
The victory, following a bitterly contested proxy battle, will come as an enormous relief to the founding Lee family as it seeks to restructure the multi-headed Samsung Group ahead of a generational transfer of power from ailing patriarch Lee Kun-Hee. 
At an emergency meeting on Friday, shareholders of construction firm Samsung C&T voted in favour of a takeover by the group's de facto holding company, Cheil Industries (KSE: 028260.KS - news ) , in an all-stock deal. 
The merger had been passionately opposed by a significant number of C&T investors, rallied by US hedge fund Elliott Associates -- the company's second-largest single shareholder. 
Elliott had argued that the takeover wilfully undervalued the C&T share price at an unacceptable cost to its shareholders.

* Purchase will make Arora second biggest individual investor
* SoftBank shares closed at 7,477 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday (Adds Son's comments, details of deal)
TOKYO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp President Nikesh Arora said he is buying about 60 billion yen ($483 million) worth of the company's shares over the next six months, calling it a show of ""commitment"" to his employer.
""I have decided to take a personal bet on the SoftBank Group and ensure an alignment of vision with our founder, Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son,"" Arora said in a press release from SoftBank.
Arora plans to buy the shares in the open market. At the closing price of 7,477 yen on Wednesday in Tokyo his cash would buy just over 8 million shares, for a 0.69 percent stake in SoftBank, making him the second biggest individual investor after Son, who welcomed the investment from his anointed successor.
""I expect him to succeed me at the appropriate time,"" Son said in the press release.
Arora became the president and chief operating officer at SoftBank in May as the Japanese company looked to step up its overseas expansion and battled to make its $20 billion 2013 acquisition of U.S. carrier Sprint Corp profitable amid intense competition with larger U.S. rivals AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.

* Arora will buy shares over six months
* Purchase will make Arora second biggest individual investor
* SoftBank shares closed at 7,477 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday (Adds Son's comments, details of deal)
TOKYO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp President Nikesh Arora said he is buying about 60 billion yen ($483 million) worth of the company's shares over the next six months, calling it a show of ""commitment"" to his employer.
""I have decided to take a personal bet on the SoftBank Group and ensure an alignment of vision with our founder, Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son,"" Arora said in a press release from SoftBank.
Arora plans to buy the shares in the open market. At the closing price of 7,477 yen on Wednesday in Tokyo his cash would buy just over 8 million shares, for a 0.69 percent stake in SoftBank, making him the second biggest individual investor after Son, who welcomed the investment from his anointed successor.
""I expect him to succeed me at the appropriate time,"" Son said in the press release.
Arora became the president and chief operating officer at SoftBank in May as the Japanese company looked to step up its overseas expansion and battled to make its $20 billion 2013 acquisition of U.S. carrier Sprint Corp profitable amid intense competition with larger U.S. rivals AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.

Oct 16 (Reuters) - Match Group Inc, the owner of dating services such as Tinder, OkCupid and Match.com, filed with U.S. regulators on Friday for an initial public offering of common stock.
The company is owned by media mogul Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp, which said in June it would float less than 20 percent of Match in an IPO.
Dating sites and apps have gained popularity in recent years with their instant messaging, photosharing and geolocation services.
Revenue rose 10.3 percent to $888.1 million in 2014, according to the company's IPO filing, while it jumped 19 percent to $254.7 million in the second quarter ended June.
""It looks like it will be well received by the IPO market ... it's got the financials that people are looking for,"" said Francis Gaskins, president of research firm IPO Desktop.
The Match unit has driven solid results for the past few quarters at IAC, though the internet search and applications business is the largest.
Match agreed to buy dating site PlentyOfFish for $575 million in July to expand in the lucrative mobile-based dating services business.
Market leader Match competes with No. 2 eHarmony and companies such as Zoosk and Spark Networks, which owns JDate and ChristianMingle, in the more than $2 billion-a-year U.S. online dating market.
JP Morgan, Allen & Co LLC and BofA Merrill Lynch are the underwriters for the offering, Match said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Match said it plans to list its stock on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""MTCH"" and set a nominal fundraising target of $100 million. ( 1.usa.gov/1GieXps )

TOKYO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to sell a new version of its Prius petrol-electric hybrid from the end of 2015 in Japan and in other regions thereafter, at a time when tumbling gasoline prices are sapping demand for environment-friendlier cars.
The new Prius will run on smaller, lighter motors and batteries than its predecessor, and be at least 10 percent more fuel-efficient, Toyota said, without stating mileage. The previous model can run at 51 miles a gallon.
Thermal efficiency - or ratio of work performed to energy consumed - will be 40 percent, up from 38.5 percent, the company also said.
The car, unveiled in Las Vegas late on Tuesday, is the first model built under the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) strategy, a new approach to development to improve its cars' fuel efficiency, styling and other features, partly by using more common components.
The launch comes at a challenging time for Toyota. U.S. petrol prices are at their lowest for this time of year since 2004, pushing consumers to trade in hybrids and electric vehicles in favour of sports utility vehicles.
August Prius sales in the U.S. fell 24 percent from the same month a year earlier to 17,757 cars. Last year, U.S. Prius sales totalled 122,800 vehicles.
Other automakers are adjusting product launches as cheap petrol muddies the sales outlook for green cars.
General Motors Co will limit the sale of its next-generation Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid - slated to launch in coming months - to California and other states where hybrid and electric cars sell well, a Chevrolet spokesman said.

The new brand identity ""aims to make Google more accessible and useful to our users"", the company said in a blog post explaining the logo. ( bit.ly/1JvGik1 )
The new logo comes three weeks after the company's surprise move to create a holding company called Alphabet to pool its many subsidiaries and separate the core web advertising business from newer ventures like driverless cars.

ATHENS, July 31 (Reuters) - Greece's stock market will reopen on Monday after a five-week shutdown caused by capital controls, but local investors will face restrictions aimed at averting capital outflows, a bourse spokeswoman said on Friday.
The Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) has been shut since June 29, when the government closed banks and imposed strict limits on withdrawals and foreign transfers to prevent a run on deposits by savers and companies.
The Finance Ministry cleared the way for the exchange to resume operations by issuing a decree setting out new trading rules for local investors. There will be no restrictions on foreign investors.
""After the finance minister signed the relevant decree earlier today, the Athens Stock Exchange board ... decided to reopen the markets of Athens Stock exchange on Monday, August 3,"" the spokeswoman said.
Traders and exchange officials had hoped the exchange would be able to reopen this week after the European Central Bank gave Greece the green light to allow normal operations by foreign investors, with some limits for local investors.
Under the ECB-approved plan, local investors would be allowed to buy shares with existing cash holdings, but not to withdraw money from their Greek bank accounts to buy shares.
Some market participants had warned that unlimited trading for domestic investors would have posed a serious risk for lenders by accelerating capital outflows.
Technical glitches at local banks, which will be required to enforce the trading restrictions, had further complicated the exchange's reopening and many securities traders have taken an early summer holiday during the closure.
Trading in all stocks including banking shares will be allowed and volatility limits will be lowered, the bourse spokeswoman said.

Private members’ club group Soho House is to raise £200m to accelerate its growth plans, opening six new houses and up to 30 new restaurants over the next two years. 
The fundraising, which is led by Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , is designed to repay existing debt and continue the expansion of the leisure company, which is majority-owned by US billionaire Ron Burkle . 
The raise is taking the form of a debt issue, details of which were released to potential investors in recent days. 
Investors have also been given unaudited accounts, which show the group generated sales of £246m in the 52 weeks to the end of June, with a loss of £17.4m. The previous year the group lost £28.4m on sales of £202.8m. 
Soho House has grown from a single members’ club on Greek Street in London’s Soho to become a sprawling leisure empire, with some 15 houses in cities as far afield as Istanbul and Miami, as well as restaurants, hotels and spas, the latter operating under the Cowshed brand. 
The company was founded by Nick Jones in 1995. In 2008 clothing magnate Richard Caring took an 80pc stake in the business for a reputed £105m. In 2012, Mr Burkle’s Yucaipa Companies invested £250m in return for a 60pc stake. Mr Jones owns 10pc, with Mr Caring the remaining 30pc.

Soho House has grown from a single members’ club on Greek Street in London’s Soho to become a sprawling leisure empire, with some 15 houses in cities as far afield as Istanbul and Miami, as well as restaurants, hotels and spas, the latter operating under the Cowshed brand. 
The company was founded by Nick Jones in 1995. In 2008 clothing magnate Richard Caring took an 80pc stake in the business for a reputed £105m. In 2012, Mr Burkle’s Yucaipa Companies invested £250m in return for a 60pc stake. Mr Jones owns 10pc, with Mr Caring the remaining 30pc. 
Accounts detail more than 50,000 members, with a 30,000 waiting list.

Oct 23 (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp on Friday reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit even as revenue dipped, hurt by foreign currency, and the news and information company reaffirmed its full-year forecast.
Third-quarter net earnings were $293 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with $250 million, or 28 cents per share, a year ago.
Adjusted for special items, earnings were 52 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were looking for 49 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In its Financial & Risk segment, which provides news and analytics to financial services companies, revenue was $1.51 billion. The division's net sales were positive in all regions except for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, marking the sixth consecutive quarter the division has seen positive net sales.
Revenues from ongoing businesses fell 4 percent to $2.98 billion, but rose 1 percent when factoring out currency. Analysts were expecting $3.04 billion.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett's company has amassed a stake worth nearly $4.5 billion in Phillips 66 more than a year after trading a chunk of its holding in the oil refiner for a chemical business investment. 
A regulatory filing says Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has accumulated about 58 million shares, which amounts to more than 10 percent of the Houston company's stock. 
In late 2013, the Omaha, Nebraska, company agreed to trade about $1.4 billion of its Phillips 66 stock for one of the refiner's businesses that makes additives to help crude oil flow through pipelines. 
Many investors watch Berkshire Hathaway filings closely because they like to copy Buffett's moves given his successful record.

Shares slumped 14 percent to 19,985 yen as of 9:16 a.m. in Tokyo, the lowest since October 2008. The maker of industrial robots and factory automation equipment said net income will probably be 159.5 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in the 12 months to March 31. That’s 17 percent lower than its April forecast and trails the 198.6 billion yen average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Fanuc said in April it would double its dividend payout ratio and buy back more shares following pressure from New York-based Loeb to share more of its about $8 billion in stockpiled cash with investors. Net income rose 12 percent to 50.8 billion yen in the fiscal first quarter, the company said in a statement, the slowest growth in six quarters.
“Orders are decreasing rapidly towards the end of the first quarter, and are expected to diminish further from the second quarter on,” Fanuc said in a statement on its website. “The future of the Chinese market is uncertain” with signs of a slowdown in demand for factory automation.
The robot maker’s ADRs slumped 8.3 percent in New York trading while its German traded shares fell as much as 11 percent, the biggest intraday drop since April 2011. Earnings were announced after market hours in Tokyo on Tuesday.
Sales gained 21 percent, also the least growth in almost a year-and-a-half, to 197.4 billion yen.

Sales of Mattel Inc.’s doll brand, its biggest product, tumbled 19 percent last quarter, dragging down overall results for the toymaker. Total revenue fell to $988.2 million, missing analysts’ $991.9 million estimate.
Barbie has lost market share to other dolls -- including some of Mattel’s own brands, like Monster High -- and faces mounting competition from the girl-oriented Lego Friends line. Barbie also has drawn increasing flak for her unrealistic body proportions. Last Christmas, “Frozen” toys unseated Barbie as the No. 1 holiday gift for girls.
“Getting Barbie back on the trajectory we want will take time,” Chief Operating Officer Richard Dickson said in a conference call Thursday after second-quarter results were released. Still, new marketing campaigns in the U.S. have had a positive impact, he said. “We’re working hard to extend our domestic momentum on the brand to all key markets worldwide.”
Mattel’s shares fell as much as 5.6 percent to $23.73 on Friday in New York, the biggest intraday drop in almost six months. The stock was already down 19 percent this year before the decline.
The strong U.S. dollar also hurt results by crimping the value of overseas sales. Even so, cost cutting helped bolster earnings last quarter. Profit amounted to 1 cent a share in the period, excluding some items. That beat analysts’ predictions for a 4-cent loss, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“While 2015 is largely expected to be a rebuilding year for many of Mattel’s beleaguered brands, we expect brand performance will remain lumpy as the narrow-moat company rights its ship,” Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., said in a note on Friday. “Second-quarter results indicate as such.”",[],2015-07-18T01:35:00.000+03:00,2015-07-17T20:54:06.000+03:00,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,www.bloomberg.com,,http://www.bloomberg.com/personal-finance,Personal-finance - Bloomberg Business,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-17/barbie-s-slump-persists-as-mattel-struggles-to-revive-doll-brand,US,Barbie Struggles to Make Comeback,0,bloomberg.com,1,Barbie Struggles to Make Comeback - Bloomberg Business,0,news,2015-07-18T01:35:00.000+03:00,0,59ed975fbfea9fbe52ccc4b664eee7fd445db257,[],[],[],288,"Barbie Struggles to Make Comeback

Apple is one of the most popular brands in China, where authorities have stepped up efforts in recent years to dispel the country's reputation for turning out counterfeit goods.
Officials have taken stiffer action to enforce intellectual property (IP) rights, pushed firms to apply for trademarks and patents and cracked down on fakes.
Police arrested nine people, including a married couple who led the operation, after a raid in May on the factory, run under the guise of a gadget maintenance shop on the northern outskirts of the Chinese capital.

The group, headed by a 43-year old man, surnamed Yu, and his 40-year old wife, surnamed Xie, both from the southern hardware manufacturing city of Shenzhen, allegedly set up the Beijing factory with six assembly lines in January, the bureau said.
They hired ""hundreds"" of workers to repackage second-hand smartphone components as iPhones for export, it added.
Police seized 1,400 handsets and large quantities of accessories during the May 14 raid. In the United States, the newest Apple Inc handsets can fetch $649, or more, depending on the model.

Last week, Arizona-based Freeport, which owns a 51 percent stake in the mine in northern Chile, became one of the first big global miners to announce it was slashing production in the wake of a slumping copper price.
That would include reducing mining rates at El Abra by about 50 percent to reduce and defer costs and extend the mine's life, the company said.
Freeport could not immediately be reached for comment.
Gustavo Tapia, head of the Chile Mining Federation union, dismissed the fall in the copper price as a ""cyclical issue"" and said multinational companies had sufficient profits to ride it out.
""In the coming hours we will decide the measures we will adopt as an organization,"" he said in a statement on Monday.
Over the weekend the company began to send letters announcing around 700 dismissals and refusing any negotiation, said Juana Mejias, who heads the mine's local union.
""The situation is complex and a true 'massacre' that they have carried out by dismissing 50 percent of the workforce,"" she said.
El Abra produced around 166,000 tonnes of refined copper last year out of Chile's total 5.7 million, according to figures from state copper commission Cochilco. That placed it just outside the top 10 biggest mines in Chile, which produces around a third of the world's copper.
Any labor action would be a fresh headache for state-run Codelco, which owns the remaining 49 percent stake in El Abra. Codelco has just resolved a three-week dispute with contractor workers across its operations, which cost some 17,000 tonnes in lost output.

LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - AXA Investment Managers said on Wednesday it had been notified that 34 billion euros ($36.95 billion) in assets it currently manages on behalf of Friends Life would move to Aviva Investors by the end of the year. 
The statement followed one from British insurer Aviva (Amsterdam: AW8.AS - news ) in which it said it planned to move some of the funds currently run by AXA (Paris: FR0000120628 - news ) in-house, following a review of its operations after buying Friends Life (Other OTC: RSLLF - news ) earlier this year. 
""From the outset, Aviva made it clear that the acquisition offers the opportunity to increase Aviva Investors' AUM (assets under management) by recapturing previously outsourced asset management contracts,"" AXA said in a statement. 
AXA said the withdrawal would likely have a ""limited negative impact"" on AXA IM's underlying earnings for 2016, and that it would receive a one-off withdrawal fee, which will be accounted for in its net income.

Europe is the largest market for chemical protective clothing in the world and is projected to retain this position over the next five years.

Stringent governmental legislation regarding the use of chemical protective clothing in Europe and North America to provide necessary chemical protective clothing to the worker is key factor driving the growth of the market. The growth of the market is restrained due to various factors such as high price of chemical protective clothing and increasing automation in various end-use industries. 
The intensity of competitive rivalry in the global chemical protective clothing market is high. The market is experiencing high growth and is expected to continue in the near future. 
The chemical protective clothing market has been analyzed both in terms of value and volume for five regions, namely, Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East & Africa, and Latin America.

Sept 10 (Reuters) - Hard-disk maker Seagate Technology Plc said it planned to cut 1,050 jobs, or 2 percent of its workforce, as part of a restructuring program.
The company said on Thursday it expected to save about $113 million annually from the restructuring and incur pretax charges of about $53 million. ( 1.usa.gov/1LYRk4e )
Seagate, which has about 52,200 employees worldwide, expects to complete the restructuring by the end of the December quarter. The company expects to incur most of the pretax charges in the first quarter, it said.
Seagate has reported a fall in sales for the past two quarters, hurt by weak demand from original equipment manufacturers, including PC makers.
Research firm International Data Corp said last month that it expected a bigger drop in 2015 PC shipments than it had anticipated earlier due to a large inventory of notebooks and a strong dollar.
To help make up for a declining PC market, Seagate and rival Western Digital Corp are expanding into the growing market for cloud data storage products.

The first phase of removing Africa’s biggest economy from the Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets, or GBI-EM, will take place at the end this month followed by a full exit by the end of October, the New York-based lender said in a statement sent to Bloomberg on Tuesday by spokesman Patrick Burton.
Nigeria’s central bank under Governor Godwin Emefiele introduced several foreign-exchange trading restrictions from December to stem the fall of the naira amid weaker oil prices. The country is Africa’s largest producer of crude, which accounts for about 90 percent of total exports and two-thirds of government revenue. JPMorgan placed Nigeria on index watch in January, saying the foreign-exchange measures made it more difficult for foreign investors to replicate the gauges.
“Investors who track the GBI-EM series continue to face challenges and uncertainty while transacting in the naira due to the lack of a fully functional two-way FX market and limited transparency,” JPMorgan said in the statement. “As a result, Nigeria will be removed.”
Nigeria will not be eligible for re-entry for at least 12 months from the date of exclusion, JPMorgan said. The country has a 1.5 percent weighting in the biggest GBI-EM index, which is tracked by $183.8 billion of funds, according to the bank.
Emefiele has repeatedly said that Nigeria wants to remain in the indexes and that there’s enough liquidity in the currency market for foreigners to buy and sell naira bonds. Average yields on those securities rose 11 basis points to 16.04 percent on Sept. 7, the highest among 18 countries included in the GBI-EM indexes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Average yields on those securities rose 11 basis points to 16.04 percent on Sept. 7, the highest among 18 countries included in the GBI-EM indexes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Spain's unemployment rate fell sharply to 22.7 percent in the second quarter, official data showed Thursday, as the govSpain:ernment boasted of creating hundreds of thousands of jobs ahead of an election. 
The key measure declined by 1.4 points from 23.78 percent in the previous quarter, with 5.15 million people unemployed overall -- 295,600 fewer than in the first quarter, the National Statistics Institute said in a statement. 
""Never in Spain's economic history have so many jobs been created in a single quarter,"" Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in a televised speech after the figures were released. 
The unemployment level is still the second-highest in the eurozone after Greece, the starkest sign of the lingering damage from the economic crisis that erupted in 2008 after a building boom went bust. 
""There are still many Spanish people and families having a very hard time. I will take care of that,"" Rajoy added in a Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) message. 
The government says the Spanish economy will create more than 600,000 jobs this year and start to chip away from next year at its debt mountain. 
It has forecast the jobless rate to sink to 21.1 percent in 2015 and dip just below the symbolic 20 percent level in 2016. 
It has raised its economic growth forecast for this year to 3.3 percent -- more than twice the 1.5 percent average rate forecast by Brussels for the eurozone. 
Rajoy's conservative Popular Party is touting the recovery ahead of an election due from November, in which it faces a tough challenge from new anti-austerity parties. 
He has warned Spain could tip back into crisis if rival parties force a change of course on the economy after the election.

MEXICO CITY Oct 22 (Reuters) - Mexico's Grupo Televisa swung to a quarterly profit from a year-ago loss, boosted by recent acquisitions in pay TV, though the company's advertising revenue fell.
The broadcaster and Spanish-language content provider on Thursday said net profit in the July to September period was 6.546 billion pesos ($387 million). That compared to a loss in the same period last year caused by a writedown on the sale of its stake in wireless business Iusacell.
Advertising revenue in the third-quarter fell 9 percent, dragging down results in its largest business, content.
Those declining revenues have been a key concern for investors, helping to drive Televisa shares about 25 percent lower since its last quarterly report in July.
Overall revenue rose 12.2 percent to 22.256 billion pesos, driven by new cable businesses it bought in the past year, Cablecom and Telecable.
Last year, as part of a sweeping reform in telecoms and broadcasting, Televisa was declared dominant in the free-to-air TV market, forcing it to allow pay TV rivals to show its free content, among other measures.
The company's pay TV business just avoided being hit with further measures, as the regulator in Mexico decided it did not have market power in the sector, despite its market share of more than 60 percent.

A US federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a $96 million award that Ecuador must pay oil giant Chevron (Swiss: CVX.SW - news ) in an arbitration of their dispute over Chevron's investments in the country. 
Judge Robert Wilkins, of the US Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, concluded that by signing the investment treaty with the United States, which took effect in 1997, ""Ecuador made a standing offer to American investors to arbitrate disputes involving investments that existed on or after the treaty's effective date."" 
The court thus upheld the previous decision of the DC federal court and validated the finding of a three-member tribunal based at The Hague. 
The arbitration decision against Ecuador also had been ratified in the Netherlands, with the Dutch Supreme Court ruling in September 2014 that Ecuador must pay the award. 
Chevron, in a statement in Spanish, said it was ""pleased"" with the appeals court decision that confirms a ""$106 million"" award, an amount that includes interest. 
In a separate case, brought by the indigenous people of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region to win compensation for the mass dumping of oilfield waste between the 1970s and 1990s, an Ecuadoran court ordered Chevron to pay $9.5 billion in damages. 
The environmental destruction allegedly was perpetrated by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001.

Virgin Australia posted a Aus$93.8 million (US$69.1 million) loss for the year on Friday, but said it was on track to return to profitability in 2016 as it reshapes its international business. 
The result was a Aus$260 million improvement on the previous year for the country's second biggest carrier after Qantas and the airline said it expected the positive trajectory would continue.

LONDON (ShareCast) - (ShareCast News) - Floor coverings group Victoria Plc (LSE: VCP.L - news ) has acquired Australia-based rival Quest Carpet Manufacturers and Quest Carpet Manufacturers Unit Trust for up to a total of £16.4m. The deal will constitute an initial cash consideration of around £11.5m and a deferred cash consideration of £4.9m. 
Victoria, which manufactures, supplies and distributes 'design-led' carpets and floor coverings, said the deferred amount will be payable in instalments of £1.6m on the anniversary of completion for each of the next three years. 
It added that the total consideration represents a multiple of a little under 5 times Quest's normalised earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation for the year ended 30 June 2015. 
The acquisition, which is expected to be immediately earnings-enhancing for Victoria's shareholders, is being funded in Australian dollars using Victoria's existing facilities with Barclays Bank and HSBC. 
Quest is based in Dandenong near Melbourne and designs, sells and distributes premium quality carpets across Australia and New Zealand. For the financial year ended 30 June, Quest generated unaudited turnover of £28.1m. 
Victoria's chairman Geoff Wilding said: ""We are delighted Victoria has been able to acquire Quest Carpets. It is an extremely well-run and growing business and it took some time to persuade the current owners to accept our offer. 
""However Quest is highly complementary to our existing business in Australia and so, while we remained disciplined with our offer, I think the vendors would agree we were quite persistent in our pursuit."" Later on Friday, Wilding sold a small portion of his stake in the company, with broker Cantor placing 1m of new shares at 1,117.5p per share to ""help satisfy continuing institutional demand"", meaning Wilding now holds 41.77%.

LONDON (ShareCast) - (ShareCast News) - Floor coverings group Victoria Plc (LSE: VCP.L - news ) has acquired Australia-based rival Quest Carpet Manufacturers and Quest Carpet Manufacturers Unit Trust for up to a total of £16.4m. The deal will constitute an initial cash consideration of around £11.5m and a deferred cash consideration of £4.9m. 
Victoria, which manufactures, supplies and distributes 'design-led' carpets and floor coverings, said the deferred amount will be payable in instalments of £1.6m on the anniversary of completion for each of the next three years. 
It added that the total consideration represents a multiple of a little under 5 times Quest's normalised earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation for the year ended 30 June 2015. 
The acquisition, which is expected to be immediately earnings-enhancing for Victoria's shareholders, is being funded in Australian dollars using Victoria's existing facilities with Barclays Bank and HSBC. 
Quest is based in Dandenong near Melbourne and designs, sells and distributes premium quality carpets across Australia and New Zealand. For the financial year ended 30 June, Quest generated unaudited turnover of £28.1m. 
Victoria's chairman Geoff Wilding said: ""We are delighted Victoria has been able to acquire Quest Carpets. It is an extremely well-run and growing business and it took some time to persuade the current owners to accept our offer. 
""However Quest is highly complementary to our existing business in Australia and so, while we remained disciplined with our offer, I think the vendors would agree we were quite persistent in our pursuit."" Later on Friday, Wilding sold a small portion of his stake in the company, with broker Cantor placing 1m of new shares at 1,117.5p per share to ""help satisfy continuing institutional demand"", meaning Wilding now holds 41.77%. At 10:20, Victoria shares were up 1.9% at 1,139p.",490,1,1

Short-term Volatility Inflows
Concerned the calm patch won’t last, traders poured $249 million into an exchange-traded note whose value increases with short-term turbulence in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

That’s the situation today -- but it follows a particularly long period of what traders call inversion, when the price of options protection is higher today than it is at some point in the future.

Oil prices tumbled Wednesday as expectations of another increase in US inventories added to worries about the global oversupply. 
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in October slid $1.79 to $44.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
Brent North Sea crude for October, the global benchmark, closed at $47.58 a barrel in London, down $1.94 from Tuesday's settlement. 
Investors are ""anxious"" about upcoming official data on US petroleum inventories, said Bob Yawger of Mizuho Securities. 
The Department of Energy (DoE) will release its weekly report Thursday, a day later than usual because of Monday's Labor Day holiday. 
The report is ""going to be a very important one. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's coming after last week, when we had a big storage build and it's basically the beginning of (refinery) maintenance season,"" said Yawger. 
""The market anticipates a pretty good build and also you'll get a reduction in the refinery utilization rate, leaving lots of crude oil on the sidelines."" 
Analysts expect commercial crude-oil inventories rose by 250,000 barrels in the week to September 4, according to a Bloomberg News. 
At the same time, the DoE predicted in a new report Wednesday that US crude-oil production would decline through the middle of next year in response to low oil prices, before picking up again in late 2016 on an expected rise in oil prices. 
US crude output fell by 140,000 barrels per day in August from July. The government lowered its 2015 production estimate to 9.2 million barrels per day, 100,000 barrels lower than its month-ago forecast.

Asset purchases introduced during the financial crisis of 2008 and beefed up in the subsequent fight against recession now represent a permanent part of the armor officials will use as a weapon against financial distress.
The bonds they bought bloated the balance sheets of the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and European Central Bank to the equivalent of about a fifth of their gross domestic product. The Fed’s alone totals $4.49 trillion, up from $810 billion in 2005.
While such excesses will eventually be pared now the turmoil has abated there is little chance the balance sheets will ever return to their pre-crisis levels for the reason that central bankers are finding advantages to running bloated stockpiles.
“It is unlikely that policy makers will simply seek to revert to balance sheet structures that prevailed ahead of the crisis,” Alain Durre and Kasper Lund-Jensen, economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a recent report.
Central-Bank Arsenals The chief argument for keeping balance sheets swollen is that it hands authorities the arsenal to provide liquidity to corners of financial markets that seize up in future. Unlike tweaking interest rates or having to ramp up the balance sheets as they did after 2008, now they have the means to act at speed and by identifying a particular target do so without distorting other assets or the economy that may not need aiding.
So if one part of the financial sector gridlocks the central bank can seek to revive it by conducting asset swaps in which it exchanges the liquid securities they hold on their balance sheets for the troubled asset, reviving the market.
There is precedent. Following their currency crises of the late 1990s, Asian central banks beefed up their foreign-exchange reserves to about a third of GDP today, even after a recent dwindling. That allows them to provide dollars to their economies and intervene to support their exchange rates if needed.
“In times of crisis, financial market frictions intensify,” wrote Durre and Lund-Jensen. “In that environment, the design -- both size and composition -- of the central bank balance sheet matters.”",[],2015-08-06T16:59:00.000+03:00,2015-08-06T14:56:58.120+03:00,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,www.bloomberg.com,,http://www.bloomberg.com/personal-finance,Personal-finance - Bloomberg Business,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-06/trillions-of-assets-remain-central-bank-tools-amid-rising-rates,US,Trillions of Assets Remain Central Bank Tools Amid Rising Rates,0,bloomberg.com,1,Trillions of Assets Remain Central Bank Tools Amid Rising Rates - Bloomberg Business,0,news,2015-08-06T16:59:00.000+03:00,0,745a8271f966e4861948444e985ea75005860a27,[],[],[],384,"Trillions of Assets Remain Central Bank Tools Amid Rising Rates

While such excesses will eventually be pared now the turmoil has abated there is little chance the balance sheets will ever return to their pre-crisis levels for the reason that central bankers are finding advantages to running bloated stockpiles.
“It is unlikely that policy makers will simply seek to revert to balance sheet structures that prevailed ahead of the crisis,” Alain Durre and Kasper Lund-Jensen, economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a recent report.
Central-Bank Arsenals The chief argument for keeping balance sheets swollen is that it hands authorities the arsenal to provide liquidity to corners of financial markets that seize up in future. Unlike tweaking interest rates or having to ramp up the balance sheets as they did after 2008, now they have the means to act at speed and by identifying a particular target do so without distorting other assets or the economy that may not need aiding.
So if one part of the financial sector gridlocks the central bank can seek to revive it by conducting asset swaps in which it exchanges the liquid securities they hold on their balance sheets for the troubled asset, reviving the market.
There is precedent. Following their currency crises of the late 1990s, Asian central banks beefed up their foreign-exchange reserves to about a third of GDP today, even after a recent dwindling. That allows them to provide dollars to their economies and intervene to support their exchange rates if needed.
“In times of crisis, financial market frictions intensify,” wrote Durre and Lund-Jensen. “In that environment, the design -- both size and composition -- of the central bank balance sheet matters.”",476,0,0

The Problem’s Spending It,[],,english,[],"Philippine President Benigno Aquino is preparing to bequeath his successor a record 3 trillion-peso ($66 billion) budget in 2016. That’s the easy part.
While some governments struggle with insufficient revenue - - see Greece --, in the Philippines the challenge is actually implementing spending that’s been approved and funded. Bureaucratic bottlenecks and fear of being caught in an anti-corruption drive have contributed to the Aquino administration missing spending targets every year since 2011.
“The president has directed all cabinet secretaries to see to it that all programs are properly implemented and completely carried out,” Communications Secretary Sonny Coloma said in an interview Tuesday.
The government has ordered agencies to submit requirements for the release of their budgets by April to fast-track approval and has increased the number of bids and awards committees in key agencies including transport, public works, health and education, according to the budget department.
“It’s not so much about how big the budget plan is, but the execution,” said Gundy Cahyadi, a Singapore-based economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. “When you look at the first quarter, growth data came in disappointing because of the rather slow pace of fiscal spending. And it’s not like they don’t have the money, because they do.”
The proposed final budget by Aquino’s administration would be 15 percent bigger than the plan for this year and double the program in 2010 when he took office, according to Budget Secretary Butch Abad. State spending in the first quarter was about 13 percent below target.
Public Works “Our focus now is to help our agencies make optimal use of their allocations,” Abad said in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. “This includes enhancing their capacities for budget planning, procurement and project implementation.”
Spending on public works will increase 32 percent from 2015 while funds for education will rise 16 percent, the budget agency said. On July 28, Aquino will submit the budget to lawmakers for their approval.
Pursuit of tax evaders and corrupt officials has given Aquino more revenue to fund roads and schools and boost cash handouts to the poor while curbing debt, efforts that led to investment-grade ratings and economic growth exceeding 6 percent since 2012.

DHAKA, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Bangladesh exported goods worth $2.76 billion in August, a 28 percent rise from a year earlier, driven by an increase in garment shipments, government data showed on Tuesday. 
Exports fell 12 percent, to $2.6 billion, in July from a year ago. 
For the first two months of the 2015-16 financial year, exports rose 4.7 percent to nearly $5.4 billion from the previous year, the Export Promotion Bureau said. 
Readymade garments, comprising knitwear and woven items, fetched $4.5 billion in July-August, compared with $4.2 billion in the same period a year ago. 
Exports in the fiscal year ending in June rose 3.35 percent to $31.2 billion from a year earlier, but that was the slowest growth since 2002 and pivotal garment sales, while higher, missed their target. 
Garments are a key foreign-exchange earner for Bangladesh, where low wages and duty-free access to Western markets have helped make it the world's second largest apparel exporter after China. 
Bangladesh raised wages for garment workers and allowed them to form trade unions late in 2013 after a string of factory accidents thrust poor pay and conditions into the international spotlight.

Acting as a backdrop, the latest German and US industrial production and wholesale inventory figures underwhelmed.

By Megha Rajagopalan
BEIJING, July 15 (Reuters) - A group of 20 foreign tourists including Britons, South Africans and an Indian national, have been arrested in northern China, according to reports by Britain's Foreign Office and a South African charity, on suspicion some had ties to a ""terror group"".
China has agreed to release 11 of the tourists, but the rest will continue to be held without charge at a detention centre in Inner Mongolia, the South African charity, Gift of the Givers Foundation, said.
Chinese authorities said some of those arrested had been watching propaganda videos from a banned group in their hotel room, the charity added in its statement.
Five South Africans, three Britons and one Indian national make up the nine being held, it said.
""Consular staff have visited the group to provide assistance and we are liaising with Chinese authorities,"" a British Foreign Office spokesman told Reuters.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry and the South African embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An Indian embassy spokesman told Reuters he had no information on the matter.
Chinese law enforcement authorities could not be immediately reached for comment.
The group was on a 47-day tour of the country when they were detained at an airport in the Inner Mongolian city of Erdos. Their tour operator realised something had gone ""horribly wrong"" on Sunday, two days later, the foundation said, when he hadn't heard from them.
""These individuals have no terror links, no criminal record in their country,"" said Gift of the Givers, which has negotiated hostage releases.

BEIJING, July 15 (Reuters) - A group of 20 foreign tourists including Britons, South Africans and an Indian national, have been arrested in northern China, according to reports by Britain's Foreign Office and a South African charity, on suspicion some had ties to a ""terror group"".
China has agreed to release 11 of the tourists, but the rest will continue to be held without charge at a detention centre in Inner Mongolia, the South African charity, Gift of the Givers Foundation, said.
Chinese authorities said some of those arrested had been watching propaganda videos from a banned group in their hotel room, the charity added in its statement.
Five South Africans, three Britons and one Indian national make up the nine being held, it said.
""Consular staff have visited the group to provide assistance and we are liaising with Chinese authorities,"" a British Foreign Office spokesman told Reuters.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry and the South African embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An Indian embassy spokesman told Reuters he had no information on the matter.
Chinese law enforcement authorities could not be immediately reached for comment.
The group was on a 47-day tour of the country when they were detained at an airport in the Inner Mongolian city of Erdos. Their tour operator realised something had gone ""horribly wrong"" on Sunday, two days later, the foundation said, when he hadn't heard from them.
""These individuals have no terror links, no criminal record in their country,"" said Gift of the Givers, which has negotiated hostage releases.
""The families thank the South African government for their unwavering support and call upon the Chinese government to release the detainees immediately.""
Several of those detained are relatives of Shameel Joosub, chief executive of telecoms company Vodacom Group Ltd., the charity added. (Additional reporting by Reuters Television and Ben Blanchard and Stephen Addison in LONDON, Editing by Larry King and Clarence Fernandez)",424,-1,-1

Britain's new opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn vowed Sunday to press ahead with plans to renationalise the rail network to create a ""People's Railway"", if his party got into power. 
In his first major policy announcement since becoming leader, the left-wing politician said England's rail franchises would be brought under public ownership as the contracts for each one expire, media reports said. 
""We know there is overwhelming support from the British people for a People's Railway, better and more efficient services, proper integration and fairer fares,"" Corbyn said in comments to the left-leaning Independent on Sunday newspaper later repeated on his official Twitter account. 
""On this issue it won't work to have a nearly-but not-quite position. Labour will commit to a clear plan for a fully integrated railway in public ownership,"" he said. 
Britain's rail network was divided into franchises under a Conservative government programme 20 years ago, but private rail companies remain heavily subsidised by the government. 
Five of the 16 franchises are due to expire between 2020 and 2025. 
Corbyn, who is expected to unveil his plans at the Labour Party conference starting in Brighton, southern England, on September 27, has always made clear his intention to renationalise the rail network along with the Royal Mail postal service. 
International Development Minister Justine Greening, the former Conservative transport minister, dismissed the plan as an ""ideological joy ride"". 
""I think it would waste millions, if not billions, of taxpayers' money,"" she told the BBC. 
The announcement comes at the end of a turbulent first week in office for the newly elected Labour leader, who notably came under fire for failing to sing the national anthem at an official engagement.

It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was the first FDA-approved treatment for sexual desire disorders in men or women. 
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Valeant will pay about $1 billion in cash for Sprout: $500 million upon the closing of the transaction, expected by end-September, and $500 million payable in the first quarter of 2016. 
Montreal-based Valeant also will pay a share of future profits benchmarked to achievement of certain milestones. 
Valeant expects Addyi to be available in the United States in the fourth quarter this year, and plans to bring the drug to the international market.

NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - ""Terminator"" star Arnold Schwarzenegger will be the new host of NBC's reality TV show ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" the network said on Monday, replacing Donald Trump who quit the show to run for U.S. president.
Schwarzenegger, 68, who returned to movie making after ending his second term as California governor in 2011, will take over when the show returns in the 2016-17 season, NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp, said in a statement.
""Arnold Schwarzenegger is the epitome of a global brand in entertainment and business, and his accomplishments in the political arena speak for themselves, "" Paul Telegdy, president of alternative programming for NBC, said in a statement.
Telegdy said Schwarzenegger had ideas for ""a fresh take"" on the show, in which celebrities compete with each other on business tasks while raising money for charities.
Trump, who coined the catch phrase ""You're fired,"" stepped down from the show earlier this year because he decided to run as Republican candidate for U.S. president in 2016. He is currently leading opinion polls.
Schwarzenegger said he was a huge fan of 'The Celebrity Apprentice' and ""the way it showcases the challenges and triumphs of business and teamwork. I am thrilled to bring my experience to the boardroom and to continue to raise millions for charity.""
The Austrian-born action hero and former bodybuilder has released a handful of movies since returning to the entertainment industry, but few have had the box office success he enjoyed in the 1980s and 1990s with films like ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""The Terminator.""
His latest outing ""Terminator: Genisys,"" released in July, brought in a disappointing $90 million at the North American box office but fared much better overseas with about $350 million, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com (Reporting by Jill Serjeant in New York and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Plumb )",[],2015-09-14T21:10:00.000+03:00,2015-09-14T20:27:27.545+03:00,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,www.reuters.com,,http://www.reuters.com/finance/personal-finance,"Wealth, Personal Finance &amp; Money | Reuters.com",http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/14/television-schwarzenegger-idUSL1N11K19920150914,US,UPDATE 1-Schwarzenegger to replace Trump as host of The Celebrity Apprentice,0,reuters.com,1,UPDATE 1-Schwarzenegger to replace Trump as host of The Celebrity Apprentice | Reuters,0,news,2015-09-14T21:10:00.000+03:00,0,c33174e5c0a9455915b857a5810d9e690b073485,[],[],[],326,"UPDATE 1-Schwarzenegger to replace Trump as host of The Celebrity Apprentice

""Arnold Schwarzenegger is the epitome of a global brand in entertainment and business, and his accomplishments in the political arena speak for themselves, "" Paul Telegdy, president of alternative programming for NBC, said in a statement.
Telegdy said Schwarzenegger had ideas for ""a fresh take"" on the show, in which celebrities compete with each other on business tasks while raising money for charities.
Trump, who coined the catch phrase ""You're fired,"" stepped down from the show earlier this year because he decided to run as Republican candidate for U.S. president in 2016. He is currently leading opinion polls.
Schwarzenegger said he was a huge fan of 'The Celebrity Apprentice' and ""the way it showcases the challenges and triumphs of business and teamwork. I am thrilled to bring my experience to the boardroom and to continue to raise millions for charity.""
The Austrian-born action hero and former bodybuilder has released a handful of movies since returning to the entertainment industry, but few have had the box office success he enjoyed in the 1980s and 1990s with films like ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""The Terminator.""
His latest outing ""Terminator: Genisys,"" released in July, brought in a disappointing $90 million at the North American box office but fared much better overseas with about $350 million, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com (Reporting by Jill Serjeant in New York and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Plumb )",446,1,0

US consumer spending edged higher in June, capping a rebound in the second quarter from weak growth in the first months of the year, the Commerce Department reported Monday. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of US economic activity, rose 0.2 percent in June after a 0.7 percent gain in May and a 0.3 percent increase in April, the department said. 
For the April-June quarter, spending increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, up from a 1.8 percent pace in the first quarter. The improvement was led by a 4.8 percent jump in goods purchases. Growth in spending on services, the sector that generates the most US jobs, was unchanged at 2.1 percent for the second consecutive quarter. 
Personal (LSE: PGH.L - news ) income rose 0.4 percent for the third month in a row in June. Real disposable income picked up slightly, to 0.5 percent growth following two months of 0.4 percent. 
Inflation remained tepid. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.3 percent year-over-year in June, accelerating slightly from May. 
Excluding food and energy, which can be volatile, so-called ""core"" PCE prices rose 1.3 percent for the sixth consecutive month, still well below the Fed's 2.0 percent target for price stability.

* China PMI data in focus
By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The dollar withered near six-week lows on Friday, reflecting doubts whether the Federal Reserve will be able to safely raise interest rates next month as once expected, given accumulating signs of stress in many parts of the global economy.
The dollar index fell to as low as 95.711, its lowest level since early July, stepping back 2.7 percent from a high of 98.334 hit two weeks ago, when many market players had thought the Fed was most likely to raise rates in September.
Traders are now quickly pricing out a September hike after minutes from the last Fed policy meeting provided no definitive indication.
They suspect the fall in commodity prices and many emerging economy assets and concerns about a slowdown in China are all making the Fed's plan to gradually raise rates more difficult.
""The market's focus is now shifting to emerging markets and the Chinese economy. I think the dollar is oversold in the near term. But if the Chinese data is weak, we could see more risk-off trades,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale.
A Chinese PMI manufacturing survey is due around 0145 GMT, with a softer reading potential putting renewed pressure on the yuan, which was mostly steady this week after devaluation last week.
The euro stood at $1.1235, little changed in early trade but near a seven-week high of $1.1245 touched on Thursday, when it had risen 1.1 percent in its biggest gain since July 10.

Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, admitted last month that it had installed software in diesel vehicles to deceive U.S. regulators about the true level of their toxic emissions, leading to a backlash against diesel motors.
The newspaper cited a position paper in which Hendricks, a member of the Social Democrats (SPD), junior coalition partner to Merkel's conservatives, said emission limits needed to be ""so exacting in future that diesel will really be cleaner due to them"".
She added: ""Companies need to learn that in the long-term they can't evade environmental protection, which is necessary.""
Diesel vehicles have been encouraged in some European markets because they can produce less carbon dioxide -- a major greenhouse gas -- than gasoline vehicles. However, they can also produce higher levels of nitrous oxides (NOx), which are harmful to human health.
Hendricks said diesel engines could only have a future if the industry could prove that it could ""make them really clean"".
She called for Europe-wide tests under real conditions and said these needed to ensure that vehicles are built in such a way that they stick to low emissions on the streets.
The costs for the system of checks would have to be borne by the manufacturers, she said.
Hendricks also said that municipalities should, in future, be able to prevent vehicles from going on the road if the level of nitrous oxides they emitted were too high.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi will let an executive order making it easier for businesses to buy land lapse on Monday after failing to win support from opposition parties in a major blow to his economic reform agenda. 
Modi said on Sunday the government was ready to amend the proposed law and criticised the spreading of false rumours that made farmers afraid of the changes. 
""I have always said that, in the dispute related to the land acquisition law, the government is open minded,"" Modi said in his monthly radio address. ""I am willing to accept any suggestion for the benefit of farmers."" 
Modi swept to power last year on expectations he would accelerate an economic transformation that began in the 1990s but is struggling to build support for reforms in parliament, where his party is in the minority in the upper house. 
Leaders of Modi's party said they had not given up on making it easier to acquire land needed to kick-start hundreds of billions of dollars in stalled projects. However, after failing to win support in parliament, they may ask states to pass their own laws. 
Modi has had to issue temporary executive orders in the past seven months that allow the government to forcibly purchase farmland for industrial development. He has failed to secure the votes in parliament needed to make the changes permanent. 
Land reform is critical for Modi's drive to build new roads, homes and factories and, if stalled, would blight his vision of 100 new 'smart' cities across India linked by industrial corridors and high-speed rail routes criss-crossing the country. 
Conflict between farmers and companies trying to secure land for industrial projects has hampered India's plans to expand its network of highways, build mines and other infrastructure, holding up about $300 billion of investment.

Starbucks currently sources coffee from nine African countries: Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Cameroon, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya. 
Global restaurant brands are increasingly investing in Africa to tap into the continent's growing middle class. U.S. coffee and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme said in May it will open 31 stores in South Africa within five years.

""Today, we're updating Facebook Search so that in addition to friends and family, you can find out what the world is saying about topics that matter to you,"" vice president of search Tom Stocky said in a blog post. 
""When something happens in the world, people often turn to Facebook to see how their friends and family are reacting."" 
He described search as an important, long-term effort at Facebook, which boasted an index of more than two trillion posts and daily searches already topping 1.5 billion daily. 
The update rolled out Thursday in US English to Facebook applications tailored for Apple (LSE: 0R2V.L - news ) or Android-powered mobile devices as well as for those accessing the social network from desktop computer browsers, according to Stocky. 
The move came as technology stars such an array of Internet giants and vie to be preferred online venues for tapping into the latest happenings. 
Facebook is battling with Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) and others to be the key source of news and conversations about news topics, especially for people on mobile devices. 
Twitter early this month made it easy to seize hot tweets and high-profile posts from the flood of real-time commentary at the one-to-many messaging service. 
A new ""Moments"" feature that lets people quickly tune into ""the best of Twitter"" made its debut in the United States with a promise it would soon spread wider.

Jose Echevarria, a spokesman for PREPA, said about 60,000 of those people remain without power, but that the agency expected to restore it by Friday afternoon.
Echevarria said most affected residents were in the north, and that no major ports or airports were affected. But residents as far south as Humacao, near the southwestern corner of the island, told Reuters they were without power.
The initial 147,000 without power represented about 4.3 percent of the island's roughly 3.5 million population.
The affected lines included a pair of 230-kilovolt lines, one linking the municipalities of Manati and Bayamon, in the north, the other between the Aguirre and Costa Sur power plants, in the south. The other two affected lines were 115-kilovolt transmissions, one linking Manati and Vega Baja, also in the north, and the other running between the major city Ponce and Santa Isabel, in the south.
Bayamon is close to San Juan, the island's capital city and business hub. Echevarria said he had no information as to whether business operations were significantly affected, but said PREPA had not heard serious complaints from businesses on the island.
In a statement, PREPA's deputy director, Carlos Castro, said PREPA was ""working on stabilizing"" its operations.
""We have incorporated reserve units and our staff is working on the problem,"" Castro said in the statement, translated from Spanish.
PREPA has made news lately as it struggles with more than $8 billion in debt. It is working to finalize a debt restructuring deal with creditors, who in turn have demanded operational overhauls that could cause PREPA to raise electricity rates and invest in improving outdated infrastructure.

“There is potential Turkish and Lufthansa could become closer,” Chief Executive Officer Temel Kotil said in an interview. “It’s the strongest carrier in northern Europe, and we’re the strongest carrier in southern Europe.”
Lufthansa rose as much as 4.6 percent in Frankfurt, the biggest gainer on Germany’s benchmark DAX Index, which was down 1.8 percent. The two airlines had previously sought to strengthen their relationship in 2012, a foray that fizzled a year later when Lufthansa pared passenger rewards from code-share flights, saying it saw little benefits from closer ties with its rival.
The two carriers are already bound together in the Star Alliance group and in charter-flight venture SunExpress. Lufthansa said in March it would use SunExpress pilots on new long-haul operations under its expanding Eurowings discount brand.
Partnerships with airlines including Lufthansa and Poland’s LOT remain key even as Turkish Airlines builds its Istanbul base into a global hub with an eye to the success of Gulf operators Dubai-Emirates, Qatar Airways Ltd. and Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJCS, Kotil said.
Lufthansa spokesman Andreas Bartels said SunExpress is an example for the “good partnership” between the two carriers, with the long-haul flights commencing in November.
A recently agreed deal with LOT will also “reinforce trunk routes” between Poland and Turkey, Kotil said. Turkish Air once explored a bid for the Warsaw-based carrier, before ending talks in 2011 because of European Union rules barring majority ownership from outside the political bloc.

The chief executive of HSBC‎ is pitching for Europe's largest bank to play a major role in financing a possible takeover of SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) by the US-based brewing giant which owns Budweiser. 
Sky News has learnt that Stuart Gulliver met executives from Anheuser-Busch InBev late last week to discuss a potential involvement for HSBC in what would be the biggest-ever takeover of a UK company. 
Mr Gulliver's ‎meeting with AB InBev directors underlines the lucrative fees associated with financing major mergers and acquisitions. 
Unlike some of his peers who run banks with retail and investment banking operations, Mr Gulliver frequently gets involved in client-facing transactional work, according to people close to him. 
The full line-up of lending banks - which will collectively provide roughly $70bn of funding for AB InBev - has not yet been determined, according to sources. 
Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Bank of America (Swiss: BAC.SW - news ) and Santander w‎ere among the lenders being lined up for financing roles. 
Sources said that Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) was also attempting to play a part in what would be the largest takeover financing this year. 
A formal offer for SAB Miller, which owns the Peroni and Grolsch brands, is expected to be tabled by AB InBev next week, and will value the London-listed company at more than $100bn. 
The success of AB InBev's offer will depend to a degree on the response of Altria, the tobacco company which makes Marlboro cigarettes and which is a 27% shareholder in SABMiller. 
The combined brewing giant which would emerge from a deal involving SABMiller‎ and AB InBev would be required to dispose of major interests in the US and China. 
Substantial job cuts triggered by the duplication of roles across the two companies would also be inevitable, analysts believe.

Thu, Sep 10, 2015, 13:07 BST - UK Markets close in 3 hrs 23 mins Kuwait signs $385 mn solar energy project AFP – 36 minutes ago View Photo 

Kuwait signed a contract worth 116 million dinars ($385 million) with Spain's TSK Group on Thursday for a 50 megawatt solar energy project as part of its renewable energy drive. 
The oil-rich Gulf state has a multi-billion-dollar plan to meet 15 percent of power demand from renewables by 2030. 
Electricity and Water Minister Ahmad al-Jassar told reporters the target is to produce 4,500 megawatts from solar and wind energy by 2030 when demand is expected to rise to 30,000 megawatts from the current 12,000 megawatts. 
The latest project is due to start production in December 2017, said Salem al-Hajraf, head of energy research at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research. 
Two smaller projects of 10 megawatts each, which were signed earlier, are expected to come onstream in May and July next year, Hajraf said. 
The first three projects have been funded by the government but future ones will be awarded to the private sector as Build-Operate-Transfer schemes, he said.

Kuwait signed a contract worth 116 million dinars ($385 million) with Spain's TSK Group on Thursday for a 50 megawatt solar energy project as part of its renewable energy drive. 
The oil-rich Gulf state has a multi-billion-dollar plan to meet 15 percent of power demand from renewables by 2030. 
Electricity and Water Minister Ahmad al-Jassar told reporters the target is to produce 4,500 megawatts from solar and wind energy by 2030 when demand is expected to rise to 30,000 megawatts from the current 12,000 megawatts. 
The latest project is due to start production in December 2017, said Salem al-Hajraf, head of energy research at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research. 
Two smaller projects of 10 megawatts each, which were signed earlier, are expected to come onstream in May and July next year, Hajraf said. 
The first three projects have been funded by the government but future ones will be awarded to the private sector as Build-Operate-Transfer schemes, he said. 
Production is expected to reach at least 2,000 megawatts by 2025, Hajraf said, adding that more projects will be offered rapidly afterwards to meet the target. 
The pioneer project will be built on a 100-square-kilometre (39-square-mile) area in Shagaya, a desert zone 100 kilometres (60 miles) west of Kuwait City, near the borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

MUNICH, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Munich prosecutors requested that 30 additional witnesses including Rupert Murdoch, publisher Friede Springer and Axel Springer Chief Executive Mathias Doepfner be summoned in a trial against Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) executives. 
Munich prosecutors are pursuing criminal allegations against current and former Deutsche Bank executives in the wake of a civil suit brought by the heirs of deceased media magnate Leo Kirch. 
Prosecutors have accused the executives of misleading the court about the bank's role in connection with the collapse of the Kirch media empire in 2002. 
They want to establish whether Deutsche Bank sought a mandate to restructure and sell parts of the Kirch empire and now want to question executives at rival media companies, prosecutors said on Friday. 
The Munich court has to approve the request before the witnesses are summoned.

A man walks past a logo of Toshiba Corp at an electronics store in Tokyo July 21, 2015. REUTERS/Thomas … TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp's chief executive apologized to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office on Wednesday after revelations of wide-spread accounting irregularities at the industrial conglomerate embarrassed government efforts to improve the country's corporate governance. 
Masashi Muromachi, interim CEO, met with an aide to Abe and apologized for the ""inconveniences caused"", a company spokeswoman said. 
An independent inquiry last month found Toshiba had inflated its profits by $1.2 billion over several years. Previous CEO Hisao Tanaka, his two predecessors and a string of other senior officials resigned from their roles. 
The scandal came as Abe's government has been trying to bolster global investors' confidence in Japan Inc with better corporate governance guidelines. 
Among large Japanese firms, Toshiba has particularly close ties with the government, with former and current executives sitting on various policy committees. 
The affair has prompted previous vice chairman Norio Sasaki, a former CEO, to quit his roles on government panels including a committee on industrial competitiveness. The former chairman of the company's audit committee, Makoto Kubo, stepped down from his position on a government accounting panel. 
Sadakazu Osaki, head of research at Nomura Research Institute's Center for Strategic Management and Innovation, said the apology reflected the degree to which Toshiba executives were involved in government panels. 
""This is because it's Toshiba. I don't think a normal company would've done that,"" he said.

Foreigners, who were also net sellers in the previous two weeks, sold a total of 707.05 billion yen ($5.89 billion) worth of Japanese cash stocks during the week of Aug. 24-28, the biggest weekly selling since March 2014, data released by the Japan Exchange Group on Thursday showed.
Foreigners sold a net 1.176 trillion yen in futures, taking the combined cash and futures net selling to 1.883 trillion yen, the highest ever, according to brokerages tracking the data.
""The figure shows that foreign investors were extremely risk-averse,"" said Seiichi Miura, an investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, adding that global investors grew more concerned that China's slowing demand could eat into production in advanced countries like Japan.
""If the market can confirm that profit growth is intact for Japanese companies at their mid-year earnings results in October, selling by foreigners will likely pause,"" Miura said.
Concerns about China's economy pushed Japanese stocks sharply down, with the Nikkei share average falling more than 13 percent from its 18-1/2 year high in late June and the broader Topix also dropping 13 percent from its eight-year peak last month.
Also keeping investors on edge is the prospects that the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise U.S. interest rates in the coming months.
Conversely, trust banks, which manage corporate pension trusts and national pension fund trusts, bought a net 263 billion yen in Japanese cash stocks, the highest since March 2009.
Traders said when the Nikkei drops below the 18,000 level, its price-to-earnings ratio drops to around 14, making Japanese stocks attractive for pension funds which tend to hunt stocks at attractively priced levels.

FRANKFURT, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom's U.S. mobile business drove a 14 percent rise in the German operator's second-quarter core profit that beat market expectations.
Second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), excluding special items, rose to 5.03 billion euros ($5.49 billion), Deutsche Telekom said on Thursday, beating the average forecast of 4.95 billion euros in a Reuters poll.
T-Mobile US, of which Deutsche Telekom owns 65.7 percent, last week already reported expectations-beating results and raised its forecast for new subscribers in 2015 for the second time this year.
The U.S. wireless operator was the biggest contributor to the group's second-quarter sales and is even bigger than Deutsche Telekom's German business.
Once faced with subscriber losses, T-Mobile has revamped pricing plans, eliminated service contracts and launched marketing campaigns to turn around its business and lure customers from bigger rivals Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.
In Germany, where Deutsche Telekom has the top spot, the company's revenues grew 2 percent to 5.6 billion euros. Adjusted EBITDA of 2.22 billion euros was down 1 percent from a year earlier but was still the biggest contributor to group profit.

(Adds Credit Suisse declining to comment) 
ZURICH, July 22 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) 's new chief executive is sounding out investors for their backing on a potential deal to bolster the bank's asset management operations, the Financial Times reported on its website on Wednesday, citing unnamed sources. 
Since taking the helm of the Swiss bank three weeks ago, former Prudential CEO Tidjane Thiam has discussed the idea of expanding the asset management division through an acquisition, the FT reported. 
Credit Suisse declined to comment. 
Asset management is the smallest of the three main businesses at Credit Suisse, which reports second-quarter results on Thursday. 
The report of potential interest in acquisitions could unsettle some investors in light of Thiam's failed attempt to buy Asian-focused insurer AIA (HKSE: 1299.HK - news ) in 2010, shortly after he became CEO of Britain's Prudential (SES: K6S.SI - news ) . 
Bankers and analysts have previously said that Thiam could tap existing shareholders for cash to improve capital strength, where it lags rival UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) , and provide growth options. 
Credit Suisse shares were down 2.2 percent at 26.73 Swiss francs at 1448 GMT, underperforming a flat European banking index.
