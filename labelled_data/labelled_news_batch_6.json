Analysts had estimated $16.74.\nSales of Tecfidera, which treats multiple sclerosis, were $883 million in the second quarter, below analysts’ estimates of $909 million. That marks another disappointing period for the drug, which in the first quarter also fell short of analyst projections.\nAnalysts have voiced concern that Tecfidera patients were being siphoned by Novartis AG’s MS drug Gilenya. Novartis’s head of pharmaceuticals said this week more people were using its medicine as a first option.\nWhile second-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.22 a share beat analysts’ average estimate of $4.10, revenue fell short. Sales of $2.59 billion compared with analysts’ projection of $2.73 billion.\nBiogen’s most closely watched product in development is an experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. But expectations moderated on Wednesday when, in a small trial, a 6-milligram dosage of the drug had no statistically significant effect on patient’s cognitive decline. The company is taking the drug, BIIB037, into final-stage testing.\nThe biotechnology company has also been expanding its pipeline of treatments that use gene-modifying technologies to treat disease. That includes a $1 billion partnership with Applied Genetic Technologies Corp., a research deal with the San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy to develop treatments for the blood disorders hemophilia A and B, and an agreement to work with Sangamo BioSciences Inc. for sickle cell disease and the blood disorder beta thalassemia.",

No injuries or arrests were reported but a few protesters threw petrol bombs at police, it was reported. \nNow Greece hopes new bailout talks can be finished before 20 August, which is when the country must repay a debt of more than €3bn to the European Central Bank, which has twice injected new funds into the banking system this week.",

        "text": "Treasuries are becoming the stars of the financial markets as tumbling commodities and stocks raise concern inflation will turn to deflation.\nU.S. government securities have returned 1 percent in July, headed for their biggest gain since January, based on Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. With the Bloomberg Commodity Index down 10 percent this month, Treasuries are beating the gauge by the most in three years.\nCrude oil has fallen more than 50 percent in the past 12 months, driving concern inflation will disappear in the world’s biggest economy. The difference between yields on one-year debt and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices, was minus 0.24 percentage point, the lowest level since January.\nAdd a decline in stocks as reason to seek the relative safety of U.S. government securities. The MSCI All-Country World Index has fallen almost 1 percent in July including reinvested dividends, as the Shanghai Composite Index slumped more than 10 percent this week.\n“Money is going to the government bond market,” said Yoshiyuki Suzuki, head of fixed income at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo. “I fear that commodity prices may go down more. There is disinflation because of the decline in oil prices.”\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.22 percent as of 10:47 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.125 percent security due in May 2025 was 99 3/32.\nDeflation is a general drop in prices. Disinflation is a slowing of inflation. Both are positive for bonds as they enhance the attraction of their fixed payments.",

        "text_full": "Treasuries Are Stars of the Markets as Traders See Deflation\nTreasuries are becoming the stars of the financial markets as tumbling commodities and stocks raise concern inflation will turn to deflation.\nU.S. government securities have returned 1 percent in July, headed for their biggest gain since January, based on Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. With the Bloomberg Commodity Index down 10 percent this month, Treasuries are beating the gauge by the most in three years.\nCrude oil has fallen more than 50 percent in the past 12 months, driving concern inflation will disappear in the world’s biggest economy. The difference between yields on one-year debt and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices, was minus 0.24 percentage point, the lowest level since January.\nAdd a decline in stocks as reason to seek the relative safety of U.S. government securities. The MSCI All-Country World Index has fallen almost 1 percent in July including reinvested dividends, as the Shanghai Composite Index slumped more than 10 percent this week.\n“Money is going to the government bond market,” said Yoshiyuki Suzuki, head of fixed income at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo. “I fear that commodity prices may go down more. There is disinflation because of the decline in oil prices.”\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.22 percent as of 10:47 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.125 percent security due in May 2025 was 99 3/32.\nDeflation is a general drop in prices. Disinflation is a slowing of inflation. Both are positive for bonds as they enhance the attraction of their fixed payments.",

( bit.ly/1I4s3BM )\nPlanet Fitness is selling 9.1 million shares in the offering, while selling stockholders are offering the rest.\nThe Newington, New Hampshire-based company, which is majority owned by buyout firm TSG Consumer Partners, has more than 950 fitness centers in the United States, most of which are franchised.\nFounded in 1992, Planet Fitness has more than 7 million members. The company's cheapest package costs just $10 per month.\nWith its basic amenities and no-frills approach, the chain caters to first-time or occasional gym users rather than those heavily into fitness.\nPlanet Fitness, whose motto is \"One Team, One Planet\", also features on the popular TV show \"The Biggest Loser.\"\nThe company aims to more than quadruple its fitness centers to over 4,000, it said in the filing.\nPlanet Fitness's revenue rose 33 percent to $279.8 million in 2014, while net income jumped 45 percent to $37.3 million.\nShares of Fitbit Inc, a maker of popular wearable fitness-tracking devices, surged as much as 60 percent in their debut in June, valuing the company at $6.5 billion.\nIndoor cycling fitness chain SoulCycle Holdings LLC has also hired investment banks for an IPO, which is expected to come later this year, Reuters reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter.\nPlanet Fitness plans to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"PLNT\".\nJP Morgan, Jefferies LLC, Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith are among the underwriters for the IPO.

( bit.ly/1I4s3BM )\nPlanet Fitness is selling 9.1 million shares in the offering, while selling stockholders are offering the rest.\nThe Newington, New Hampshire-based company, which is majority owned by buyout firm TSG Consumer Partners, has more than 950 fitness centers in the United States, most of which are franchised.\nFounded in 1992, Planet Fitness has more than 7 million members. The company's cheapest package costs just $10 per month.\nWith its basic amenities and no-frills approach, the chain caters to first-time or occasional gym users rather than those heavily into fitness.\nPlanet Fitness, whose motto is \"One Team, One Planet\", also features on the popular TV show \"The Biggest Loser.\"\nThe company aims to more than quadruple its fitness centers to over 4,000, it said in the filing.\nPlanet Fitness's revenue rose 33 percent to $279.8 million in 2014, while net income jumped 45 percent to $37.3 million.\nShares of Fitbit Inc, a maker of popular wearable fitness-tracking devices, surged as much as 60 percent in their debut in June, valuing the company at $6.5 billion.\nIndoor cycling fitness chain SoulCycle Holdings LLC has also hired investment banks for an IPO, which is expected to come later this year, Reuters reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter.\nPlanet Fitness plans to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"PLNT\".\nJP Morgan, Jefferies LLC, Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith are among the underwriters for the IPO.

        "text": "A rally in Brazilian banks sparked a recovery in the Ibovespa from the longest slide since 2013, even after Standard & Poor’s cut the nation’s outlook to negative.\nThe benchmark equity gauge led gains in the Americas, following a slump that sent its valuation to the lowest level in four months. Stocks pared their advance after the rating company cited increased political uncertainty amid the country’s largest-ever corruption probe.\n“Investors are just buying stocks that look attractive after the steep decline of the past few days,” Hersz Ferman, an economist at brokerage Elite Corretora, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. “That doesn’t mean any change in the outlook for Brazil as prospects for the economy remain very negative.”\nThe shares entered a bull market in April, after rallying more than 20 percent from this year’s low, on speculation that government measures would help shore up the budget and avoid the loss of Brazil’s investment-grade status. Since then, they’ve dropped 12 percent as President Dilma Rousseff struggles to tame above-target inflation and stimulate growth amid a widening bribery probe at the state oil company.\nThe stock gauge rose 1.5 percent to 49,477.61 at 1:30 p.m. in Sao Paulo. Lenders Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA advanced at least 1.2 percent after their valuation discount to the Ibovespa had widened to more than 40 percent.\nThe Ibovespa also rose Tuesday as miner Vale SA rebounded from a decade low amid a jump in iron ore. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the oil producer at the center of Brazil’s biggest corruption scandal, climbed for the first time in eight days.\nPulp producers Fibria Celulose SA and Suzano Papel e Celulose SA rallied as a currency slide to a 12-year low improved the outlook for exports.",

        "text_full": "Bank Gain Spurs Brazil Stock Rebound Even After S&P Outlook Cut\nA rally in Brazilian banks sparked a recovery in the Ibovespa from the longest slide since 2013, even after Standard & Poor’s cut the nation’s outlook to negative.\nThe benchmark equity gauge led gains in the Americas, following a slump that sent its valuation to the lowest level in four months. Stocks pared their advance after the rating company cited increased political uncertainty amid the country’s largest-ever corruption probe.\n“Investors are just buying stocks that look attractive after the steep decline of the past few days,” Hersz Ferman, an economist at brokerage Elite Corretora, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. “That doesn’t mean any change in the outlook for Brazil as prospects for the economy remain very negative.”\nThe shares entered a bull market in April, after rallying more than 20 percent from this year’s low, on speculation that government measures would help shore up the budget and avoid the loss of Brazil’s investment-grade status. Since then, they’ve dropped 12 percent as President Dilma Rousseff struggles to tame above-target inflation and stimulate growth amid a widening bribery probe at the state oil company.\nThe stock gauge rose 1.5 percent to 49,477.61 at 1:30 p.m. in Sao Paulo. Lenders Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA advanced at least 1.2 percent after their valuation discount to the Ibovespa had widened to more than 40 percent.\nThe Ibovespa also rose Tuesday as miner Vale SA rebounded from a decade low amid a jump in iron ore. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the oil producer at the center of Brazil’s biggest corruption scandal, climbed for the first time in eight days.\nPulp producers Fibria Celulose SA and Suzano Papel e Celulose SA rallied as a currency slide to a 12-year low improved the outlook for exports.",

        "text": "Vale SA boosted iron-ore production in the second quarter climbed to the second-highest ever for the company, exceeding analyst estimates and worsening a supply glut that saw prices of the steelmaking ingredient collapse.\nIron-ore output rose 7.4 percent to 85.3 million metric tons in the quarter through June 30, compared with 79.4 million tons a year ago, the company said in a statement Thursday. The result, which excludes third-party purchases and operations at a venture with BHP Billiton Plc, topped the 82.5 million-ton average of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe Rio de Janeiro-based company is expanding supply to a record 340 million metric tons this year while seeking to replace low-quality ore with premium products to improve profits. The expansion by Vale and its main rivals BHP and Rio Tinto Group coincides with an unexpected decline in demand from China, the biggest iron-ore buyer, prompting Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to forecast weaker prices in incoming quarters.\nVale, also the world’s largest nickel producer, said output of the industrial metal rose more than 8 percent to 67,100 tons, compared with a 73,900-ton average forecast by seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.",

The fund seeks to help alleviate that.\n\"These are the communities our employees live in and we want to respect those communities,\" Tim McIlwain, XTO's head of operations, told a news conference.\nThe donation was the largest since the fund was established in 2011, eclipsing the $3 million Marathon Oil Corp donated in 2012.\nThe fund can accept up to $30 million in donations each year, according to a law passed by the state legislature. The fund, in turn, uses the money to subsidize apartment construction. The apartments must be rented at income-adjusted levels for 15 years.\nWhile housing prices across North Dakota's oil patch have come down recently, they still far eclipse prices before the state's oil boom began in 2008. Prices have slid recently as the region's economy has stabilized. A more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices in the past year has also taken some of the premium off housing.\nA typical one-bedroom apartment in Williston runs about $1,700 per month, but at a facility built with money from the housing incentive fund the cost for a similar apartment costs about $800 per month.\n\"This housing fund is a key component of keeping things moving the way they should be moving in a fast-growing economy,\" Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, said at the press conference.\nExxon Mobil is the only oil company to have donated to the fund since January, state officials said.

        "text": "The ruble weakened past 60 against the dollar for the first time since March, tracking the price of oil and raising the likelihood that Russia’s central bank will hold off on cutting interest rates this week.\nThe currency fell 1.1 percent to 60.32 per dollar by 10:23 a.m. in Moscow.

        "text": "Russia’s central bank halted purchases of foreign currency to replenish the country’s international reserves, sending the ruble toward its biggest gain in almost three weeks.\nThe operations were suspended from July 28 as a result of “growth in volatility on the domestic currency market,” the regulator said in a website statement on Wednesday. It also said that currency purchases were reduced to $160 million on Monday from $200 million daily last week.\n“The Bank of Russia has repeatedly stated that it will minimize the impact of operations to replenish international reserves on the currency market, quickly adjusting the volume of purchases,” the central bank said in an e-mailed statement.\nThe central bank, which allowed the ruble to trade freely last year amid Russia’s worst currency crisis since 1998, resumed currency purchases in mid-May to gradually rebuild reserves to $500 billion. It’s purchased about $10 billion since announcing its policy shift on May 13.\nThe ruble traded 0.5 percent stronger at 59.7260 against the dollar as of 10:17 a.m. in Moscow. The Russian currency’s three-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings, is at 19 percent, the highest globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",

        "text": "New Zealand’s dollar climbed to a two-week high after Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler cast doubt on the need for deep interest-rate cuts, with traders brushing aside his call that further currency depreciation is needed.\nThe kiwi, named for the image of the flightless bird on its NZ$1 coin, climbed versus all of its major peers for a second day even after Wheeler said “a more substantial” weakening in the currency is necessary during a speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Tauranga, New Zealand on Wednesday. Traders pared bets on the pace of policy easing after Wheeler said the economy isn’t weak enough to warrant big reductions in interest rates.\n“Wheeler’s comments today continued to be more balanced than markets had been hoping for and confirmed recent reductions in positions shorting the kiwi,” said Sam Tuck, a senior currency strategist at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd. in Auckland. “Longer-term drivers of the currency remain in place with trend declines expected to continue after a period of consolidation.”\nPolicy makers lowered the benchmark cash rate in June, and again last week, as slumping dairy prices weighed on the economy. The RBNZ however removed language describing the currency as “overvalued” in its statement, spurring a rally in the local dollar.\nThe kiwi gained 0.5 percent to 67.22 U.S. cents as of 9:18 a.m. in Wellington. It slumped to six-year low earlier this month.\n“Some local commentators have predicted large declines in interest rates over coming months that could only be consistent with the economy moving into recession,” Wheeler said in the speech as published on the RBNZ’s website. “At this point, we believe that several factors are supporting economic growth.”\nWhile most economists predict two more reductions by October, returning the key rate to a record 2.5 percent, some see even deeper cuts.",

Some analysts had expected 100bn or more of issuance in 2015, but at the current run rate it will likely fall short of that. \nAt its peak, the ABS market saw volumes of US$1.2trn in 2008, according to research group Bruegel. \nBarclays will now focus its efforts on the booming US securitisation business, the source said. \nBarclays currently ranks fourth in the Thomson Reuters US ABS league tables with a 9.1% market share for this year.

        "text": "Chinese companies have found a guaranteed way to prevent investors from selling their shares: suspend trading.\nAlmost 200 stocks halted trading after the close on Monday, bringing the total number of suspensions to 745, or 26 percent of listed firms on mainland exchanges, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of the halts are by companies listed in Shenzhen, which is dominated by smaller businesses.\nThe suspensions have locked up $1.4 trillion of shares, or 21 percent of China’s market capitalization, and are becoming increasingly popular as equity prices tumble. If not for the halts, a 29 percent plunge in the Shanghai Composite Index from its June 12 peak would probably be even deeper.\n“Their main objective is to prevent share prices from slumping further amid a selling stampede,” said Chen Jiahe, a strategist at Cinda Securities Co.\nThe rout in Chinese shares has erased at least $3.2 trillion in value, or twice the size of India’s entire stock market. The Shenzhen Composite Index has led declines with a 39 percent plunge since its June 12 peak, as margin traders unwound bullish bets.\nIn the U.S., there are 121 halted companies comprising less than 0.2 percent of market capitalization. In Hong Kong, 186 firms are suspended, representing 4.7 percent of the city’s equity market cap.\nSearainbow Holding Corp. halted trading on Friday in Shenzhen after losing 54 percent in just three weeks. The company, which makes chemical fibers and online games, had surged 150 percent this year through its high on June 11. Wuhu Shunrong Sanqi Interactive Entertainment Network Technology Co. suspended its shares on Monday after a six-day, 34 percent plunge. The stock is still up 99% this year.\nThe increasing number of halts will deter investors from buying shares on concern any purchases they make will also end in suspensions, said Steve Wang, chief China economist at Reorient Financial Markets Ltd. in Hong Kong.",

        "text_full": "Chinese Trading Suspensions Freeze $1.4 Trillion of Shares Amid Rout\nChinese companies have found a guaranteed way to prevent investors from selling their shares: suspend trading.\nAlmost 200 stocks halted trading after the close on Monday, bringing the total number of suspensions to 745, or 26 percent of listed firms on mainland exchanges, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of the halts are by companies listed in Shenzhen, which is dominated by smaller businesses.\nThe suspensions have locked up $1.4 trillion of shares, or 21 percent of China’s market capitalization, and are becoming increasingly popular as equity prices tumble. If not for the halts, a 29 percent plunge in the Shanghai Composite Index from its June 12 peak would probably be even deeper.\n“Their main objective is to prevent share prices from slumping further amid a selling stampede,” said Chen Jiahe, a strategist at Cinda Securities Co.\nThe rout in Chinese shares has erased at least $3.2 trillion in value, or twice the size of India’s entire stock market. The Shenzhen Composite Index has led declines with a 39 percent plunge since its June 12 peak, as margin traders unwound bullish bets.\nIn the U.S., there are 121 halted companies comprising less than 0.2 percent of market capitalization. In Hong Kong, 186 firms are suspended, representing 4.7 percent of the city’s equity market cap.\nSearainbow Holding Corp. halted trading on Friday in Shenzhen after losing 54 percent in just three weeks. The company, which makes chemical fibers and online games, had surged 150 percent this year through its high on June 11. Wuhu Shunrong Sanqi Interactive Entertainment Network Technology Co. suspended its shares on Monday after a six-day, 34 percent plunge. The stock is still up 99% this year.\nThe increasing number of halts will deter investors from buying shares on concern any purchases they make will also end in suspensions, said Steve Wang, chief China economist at Reorient Financial Markets Ltd. in Hong Kong.",

        "text": "Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc cut its full-year profit guidance and halted a share buyback to preserve cash, days after new Chief Executive Officer Warren East took over at the U.K. manufacturer of aircraft engines and marine products.\nPretax profit will reach 1.3 billion pounds ($2 billion) to 1.47 billion pounds, down from a previous estimate of 1.4 billion pounds to 1.55 billion pounds, the company said in a statement Monday. Free cash flow may be negative at 150 million pounds and reach 150 million pounds at best, down from an earlier plan of as much as 350 million pounds.\nEast, an engineer who has worked in the semiconductor industry, is halting the 1 billion-pound share buyback program at the halfway mark and said that the company will need to deepen a restructuring at the marine unit, which has suffered as the slumping oil price prompts customer in the offshore industry buy less equipment.\n“I am clearly disappointed by today’s announcement and the impact this will have on our investors and employees,” East said in the release. “Notwithstanding the market developments, it is our responsibility to build a business that is sustainable and resilient no matter what is thrown at us and this will be my fundamental priority for the next few years.”\nThe jet-engine unit, Rolls-Royce’s largest by revenue, has been challenged by an engine transition on the Airbus A330 wide-body airliner, the company said. In addition, lower-than-expected demand for engines to power business jets and a softening regional aftermarket will also adversely impact profit. Those effects will lead to a 300 million-pound hit on profit at the subsidiary in 2016.\nEast took over from John Rishton, who stepped down after several profit revisions on his watch.",

Free cash flow may be negative at 150 million pounds and reach 150 million pounds at best, down from an earlier plan of as much as 350 million pounds.\nEast, an engineer who has worked in the semiconductor industry, is halting the 1 billion-pound share buyback program at the halfway mark and said that the company will need to deepen a restructuring at the marine unit, which has suffered as the slumping oil price prompts customer in the offshore industry buy less equipment.\n“I am clearly disappointed by today’s announcement and the impact this will have on our investors and employees,” East said in the release. “Notwithstanding the market developments, it is our responsibility to build a business that is sustainable and resilient no matter what is thrown at us and this will be my fundamental priority for the next few years.”\nThe jet-engine unit, Rolls-Royce’s largest by revenue, has been challenged by an engine transition on the Airbus A330 wide-body airliner, the company said. In addition, lower-than-expected demand for engines to power business jets and a softening regional aftermarket will also adversely impact profit. Those effects will lead to a 300 million-pound hit on profit at the subsidiary in 2016.\nEast took over from John Rishton, who stepped down after several profit revisions on his watch.",

The debt is ranked Ca, the second-lowest rating from the New York-based company.\n“We believe that the probability of default is approaching 100 percent, and that losses given default are substantial,” Moody’s analysts wrote. “Bondholder recoveries will be lowest on securities lacking explicit contractual or other legal protections.”\nInvestors including BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co. have speculated about bondholder losses in Puerto Rico since Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla last month called the island’s $72 billion of debt unpayable. Moody’s said the commonwealth could support 60 percent to 65 percent of its net tax-supported debt, assuming no economic rebound.\nHolders of debt with stronger safeguards, like general obligations and bonds from the commonwealth’s Electric Power Authority and Aqueduct and Sewer Authority would probably fare better than others, with recoveries of 65 percent to 80 percent, Moody’s said.\nThe credit rater said its estimates are based on cuts in principal and interest payments of about 40 percent a year through 2023, as the government decides to reduce debt service payments to avoid budget shortfalls.\nBankruptcy alone wouldn’t be enough to dig Puerto Rico out from under its debt burden, Moody’s said.\nIf Puerto Rico agencies had access to Chapter 9, island officials have said it may apply only to certain public corporations, such as the power utility, water agency and highway authority.

Learn more... \nMon, Jul 20, 2015, 14:05 BST - UK Markets close in 2 hrs 25 mins Ferrari recalls 2,600 cars globally over airbags risk AFP – 27 minutes ago View Photo \n\nItaly sports car giant Ferrari has recalled 2,600 cars globally because of a default in airbags supplied by Japanese company Takata (Frankfurt: 7TK.F - news ) , the company said Monday. \n\"The issue is a possible production defect in a component inside the airbags, which were fitted to around 2,600 cars,\" a Ferrari spokesman told AFP. \nThe US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday that more than 800 of the cars were being recalled in North America. \nThe vehicles may be equipped with a driver-side airbag \"that was improperly assembled\" causing the airbag \"to deploy in a rotated orientation,\" the company reported earlier, saying there was a greater risk of injury. \n\"This issue is not related to the other recall made by other manufactures for Takata airbags,\" the spokesman for the high-end Italian automaker said. \nFerrari's problem with assembling the airbags comes amid a roiling scandal over defective Takata airbags, which have been linked to eight deaths and more than 100 injuries around the world. \nTen global automakers, including General Motors (NYSE: GM - news ) , Honda and Germany's BMW (Swiss: BMW.SW - news ) , are recalling 34 million cars in the United States alone to replace the inflators -- the biggest recall in US history.",

        "text": "Altice SA offered about 607 million euros ($669 million) to take over NextRadioTV alongside the French TV and digital media company’s founder Alain Weill.\nThe deal, which would bulk up billionaire Patrick Drahi’s media holdings after he bought daily newspaper Liberation, involves the creation of a joint venture between Altice and Weill, Altice said Monday in a statement. The venture is bidding 37 euros a share for NextRadioTV, 16 percent more than the stock’s closing price of 31.80 euros on Friday in Paris.\nWeill will ultimately own 24 percent of a subsidiary of Altice dedicated to investing in media companies and help the cable and telecommunications empire expand beyond France, Luxembourg-based Altice said.\nSince its 2014 initial public offering, Altice has become one of Europe’s most acquisitive telecommunications companies. Drahi is in the process of converting the company into a new entity to gain a new stock for bigger takeovers.\nNextRadioTV owns assets including BFMTV, which last month was among France’s 15 most watched TV channels with a 2 percent share of the national audience.\nAmong Drahi’s media assets are magazines including France’s L’Express and L’Expansion.",

The venture is bidding 37 euros a share for NextRadioTV, 16 percent more than the stock’s closing price of 31.80 euros on Friday in Paris.\nWeill will ultimately own 24 percent of a subsidiary of Altice dedicated to investing in media companies and help the cable and telecommunications empire expand beyond France, Luxembourg-based Altice said.\nSince its 2014 initial public offering, Altice has become one of Europe’s most acquisitive telecommunications companies. Drahi is in the process of converting the company into a new entity to gain a new stock for bigger takeovers.\nNextRadioTV owns assets including BFMTV, which last month was among France’s 15 most watched TV channels with a 2 percent share of the national audience.\nAmong Drahi’s media assets are magazines including France’s L’Express and L’Expansion.",

Learn more... \nTue, Jul 28, 2015, 04:08 BST - UK Markets open in 3 hrs 52 mins Shanghai shares open down more than 4% after plunge AFP – 50 minutes ago View Photo \n\nChina's benchmark Shanghai stock index slumped 4.09 percent at the open on Tuesday, despite a renewed government vow to support the market following the biggest fall in eight years a day earlier. \nThe Shanghai Composite Index plunged 8.48 percent on Monday, the biggest fall since February 27, 2007, despite a broad-based government effort to shore up prices following a weeks-long rout. \nThe benchmark narrowed some of the losses in morning trade Tuesday and was down 2.12 percent, or 78.88 points, to 3,646.68 later. \nThe Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, was down 3.52 percent, or 75.93 points, to 2,084.16. \nThe falls came despite comments by the market regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), that it would continue to \"stabilise\" the market. \nThe state-backed China Securities Finance Corp., tasked with stabilising the market, would continue to increase its share holdings, the CSRC said in a statement late Monday. \n\"It's a normal correction of the market since it rose too much before,\" Zhang Yanbing, an analyst at Zheshang Securities, told AFP. \nHe added it would take some time for trading to become less volatile. \n\"In the future, the market will gradually rise and stabilise and finally return to a normal state,\" he said. \nThe government intervened after the market plunged 30 percent in just three weeks from mid-June, having risen more than 150 percent in the previous 12 months. \nEarly efforts failed to change sentiment, until the government banned shareholders with more than five percent stakes from selling stock and launched a police crackdown on short selling. \nThe market rallied for six sessions until Friday, when an independent survey of manufacturing activity hit a 15-month low in July.",

        "text": "Shopify Inc. surged as much as 18 percent after reporting revenue in its first quarter as a public company that beat analysts’ estimates.\nShares of the Canadian maker of software for online retailers increased 10 percent to $37.60 at 10:20 a.m. in New York, and reached as high as $40.25, the biggest jump since the company’s initial public offering on May 21. The stock had doubled through Wednesday.\nRevenue was $44.9 million, 89 percent higher than the same quarter last year, as Shopify processed more payments on its platform, the Ottawa-based company said in a statement Thursday.

The acquisition would allow Xoom to expand into new markets with less execution risk, Xoom CEO John Kunze said on Wednesday.\nXoom will operate as a separate service within PayPal after the completion of the deal.\nPayPal faces increasing competition from rivals like Stripe and Square, which is popular with smaller businesses, and Apple Inc's Apple Pay.

It intends to fund the transaction with cash on its balance sheet.\nPayPal said the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015, will slightly hurt its adjusted earnings per share for 2016. The company is slated to separate from eBay this month and list as an independent company.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is financial adviser to PayPal, while Sidley Austin LLP is its legal adviser.

While some expect the first hike to come as early as September, many economists say it could come later in the year, or even next year, depending on the strength of U.S. economic data.\nThe Bank of Japan offered to buy 375 billion yen ($3.03 billion) of JGBs in the 1-year to 3-year zone, 425 billion yen of JGBs in the 3-year to 5-year zone, 240 billion yen of JGBs in the 10-year to 25-year zone, and 140 billion yen of JGBs in the over 25-year zone under its asset purchase programme.\nThe results indicated a higher-than-expected inclination to sell, according to market participants, which weighed on JGB prices and pushed up yields.\nThe benchmark 10-year JGB yield edged up half a basis point to 0.405 percent, while the 30-year yield rose 1.5 basis points to 1.415 percent.\nThe 10-year JGB futures price ended up 0.04 point at 147.59 .\n($1 = 123.61 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo markets team)",

While some expect the first hike to come as early as September, many economists say it could come later in the year, or even next year, depending on the strength of U.S. economic data.\nThe Bank of Japan offered to buy 375 billion yen ($3.03 billion) of JGBs in the 1-year to 3-year zone, 425 billion yen of JGBs in the 3-year to 5-year zone, 240 billion yen of JGBs in the 10-year to 25-year zone, and 140 billion yen of JGBs in the over 25-year zone under its asset purchase programme.\nThe results indicated a higher-than-expected inclination to sell, according to market participants, which weighed on JGB prices and pushed up yields.\nThe benchmark 10-year JGB yield edged up half a basis point to 0.405 percent, while the 30-year yield rose 1.5 basis points to 1.415 percent.\nThe 10-year JGB futures price ended up 0.04 point at 147.59 .\n($1 = 123.61 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo markets team)",

Combined with cost cuts across the business, that led to operating profit of 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion), slightly ahead of a consensus of 1.3 billion pounds and up 18 percent on a year ago. \n\"The investments we have made have given us a strong platform on which to build and we have a clear set of plans to deliver long-term growth and returns for our shareholders,\" Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said. \nSky, which is engaged in a fierce battle at home with rivals such as BT and Virgin Media to provide pay-TV, broadband and telephony, said it had been helped across the five countries by improved customer loyalty and demand for an increasing number of services. \n($1 = 0.6409 pounds) (Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Neil Maidment)",

Combined with cost cuts across the business, that led to operating profit of 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion), slightly ahead of a consensus of 1.3 billion pounds and up 18 percent on a year ago. \n\"The investments we have made have given us a strong platform on which to build and we have a clear set of plans to deliver long-term growth and returns for our shareholders,\" Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said. \nSky, which is engaged in a fierce battle at home with rivals such as BT and Virgin Media to provide pay-TV, broadband and telephony, said it had been helped across the five countries by improved customer loyalty and demand for an increasing number of services. \n($1 = 0.6409 pounds) (Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Neil Maidment)",

        "text": "Warren Buffett helped take over H.J. Heinz in 2013 and facilitated its combination with Kraft Foods Group Inc. this year. His prize: a stake of about $24 billion in the new company, which began trading Monday.\nKraft Heinz changed hands for $72.67 at 9:40 a.m. in New York trading. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns about 325 million shares after investing approximately $9.5 billion over the transactions to acquire common stock.\nThe trading debut shows just how lucrative Buffett’s partnership with investment firm 3G Capital has been. The buyout shop, co-founded by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, orchestrated both the Heinz and Kraft deals and will run the combined business. 3G is known for cutting costs and jobs to boost margins.\nLemann and his partners have built “marvelous businesses,” Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting in May. “After they reduced the headcount to the number needed, the companies have done extremely well.”\nAlready, 3G has moved to shake up leadership at the food company. Last week, Kraft Heinz announced a raft of management changes , including the departure of several Kraft executives. The company set a goal of cutting $1.5 billion in annual costs at the business by the end of 2017.\nKraft Heinz is now Buffett’s second-biggest stock investment, ahead of Coca-Cola Co. and International Business Machines Corp. The largest, a stake in Wells Fargo & Co., was valued at more than $26 billion on Monday.\nBuffett also owns $8 billion of preferred shares in Kraft Heinz that pay 9 percent in dividends annually. The securities can be redeemed next year.",

        "text_full": "Buffett’s Kraft Heinz Bet Valued at $24 Billion in Debut\nWarren Buffett helped take over H.J. Heinz in 2013 and facilitated its combination with Kraft Foods Group Inc. this year. His prize: a stake of about $24 billion in the new company, which began trading Monday.\nKraft Heinz changed hands for $72.67 at 9:40 a.m. in New York trading. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns about 325 million shares after investing approximately $9.5 billion over the transactions to acquire common stock.\nThe trading debut shows just how lucrative Buffett’s partnership with investment firm 3G Capital has been. The buyout shop, co-founded by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, orchestrated both the Heinz and Kraft deals and will run the combined business. 3G is known for cutting costs and jobs to boost margins.\nLemann and his partners have built “marvelous businesses,” Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting in May. “After they reduced the headcount to the number needed, the companies have done extremely well.”\nAlready, 3G has moved to shake up leadership at the food company. Last week, Kraft Heinz announced a raft of management changes , including the departure of several Kraft executives. The company set a goal of cutting $1.5 billion in annual costs at the business by the end of 2017.\nKraft Heinz is now Buffett’s second-biggest stock investment, ahead of Coca-Cola Co. and International Business Machines Corp. The largest, a stake in Wells Fargo & Co., was valued at more than $26 billion on Monday.\nBuffett also owns $8 billion of preferred shares in Kraft Heinz that pay 9 percent in dividends annually. The securities can be redeemed next year.",

(AP) -- North Dakota oil drillers in May nearly matched the state's record production despite weak crude prices. \nThe Department of Mineral Resources says North Dakota oil production was pegged at 1.2 million barrels daily in May. That's up about 3 percent from April. \nMay's production was about 20,000 barrels a day less than the record set in December. Oil production figures have a two-month lag time. \nThe state produced 50 million cubic feet of natural gas in May, an all-time high. The natural gas flaring rate remained unchanged at 18 percent.

        "text": "Greece will reach a deal with its creditors allowing the nation to remain in the euro area because the potential price for failure is too high, said Angel Gurria, head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n“There are too many people who have a lot at stake who are very important and very smart, and everybody wants a deal,” Gurria, the OECD secretary-general, said in an interview in Mexico City on Monday. “We know the cost of some of the solutions. We don’t know the cost of not having one.”\nUnless it finds a way out of its cash crunch, Greece could drift toward an exit from the euro area -- an outcome that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other European leaders say they want to prevent at all costs. Gurria said he expects Greece to avoid a debt default because it wouldn’t be in the best interests of the nation nor its creditors.\n“Everybody has constraints,” said Gurria, 65, who served as Mexico’s chief negotiator during a debt restructuring in the late 1980s and then as finance minister before taking the helm of the Paris-based OECD in 2006.\n“The secret is to what extent does every one of the parties understand the others’ constraints, and how can you accommodate that,” Gurria said.\nEarlier Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said “time is running out” for Tsipras to come up with a plan to keep his country in the euro as its citizens endure a second week of capital controls. Finance ministers from the 19-member region are set to gather on Tuesday for an emergency meeting.\n“I don’t see anybody leaving the euro, I see more people wanting to join the euro,” Gurria said.",

We don’t know the cost of not having one.”\nUnless it finds a way out of its cash crunch, Greece could drift toward an exit from the euro area -- an outcome that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other European leaders say they want to prevent at all costs. Gurria said he expects Greece to avoid a debt default because it wouldn’t be in the best interests of the nation nor its creditors.\n“Everybody has constraints,” said Gurria, 65, who served as Mexico’s chief negotiator during a debt restructuring in the late 1980s and then as finance minister before taking the helm of the Paris-based OECD in 2006.\n“The secret is to what extent does every one of the parties understand the others’ constraints, and how can you accommodate that,” Gurria said.\nEarlier Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said “time is running out” for Tsipras to come up with a plan to keep his country in the euro as its citizens endure a second week of capital controls. Finance ministers from the 19-member region are set to gather on Tuesday for an emergency meeting.\n“I don’t see anybody leaving the euro, I see more people wanting to join the euro,” Gurria said.",

However, the timing of the anticipated benefit was uncertain. \n($1 = 0.6431 pounds) (Reporting by Aashika Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi)",

However, the timing of the anticipated benefit was uncertain. \n($1 = 0.6431 pounds) (Reporting by Aashika Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi)",

        "text": "WILLISTON, N.D., July 8 A power outage in North Dakota's capital on Wednesday brought down computer servers that provide data used to track myriad output statistics across the second-largest U.S. oil producing state.\nThe outage means the state's daily drilling rig count - a closely watched number that can offer guidance on future oil production - is not available. The count stood at 76 on Tuesday, near where it has been for several weeks.\nThe rig count is tabulated daily by the state's Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), North Dakota's oil regulator. Field inspectors upload data to servers in Bismarck, which aggregates the data and automatically publishes it to a public website every day.\nThe DMR website also provides in-depth data on the depth and length of the state's nearly 15,000 wells, as well as oil production history. A mapping function graphically shows much of this data, including the location of each drilling rig operating in the state.\n\"We're hoping to get power back soon to the servers, but we're just not sure on timing,\" said Alison Ritter, a DMR spokeswoman.\nMDU Resources Group, which owns the utility for the region, reported that a problem at a substation in northern Bismarck cut electricity to an unknown number of customers. Crews arrived on the scene at roughly 8:30 a.m. local time (1330 GMT) to assess damage, said Rick Matteson, an MDU spokesman.\n\"They're not sure what the problem is and they don't as yet have an estimate for a restoration time,\" Matteson said.\nUtility customers reported waits of more than 90 minutes to contact MDU's customer service line.\nNorth Dakota produces roughly 1.2 million barrels of oil per day, according to the latest monthly report from the DMR.\nProduction statistics for May are scheduled to be released on Friday.

Confidence at big Japanese manufacturers unexpectedly improved in the second quarter and is seen rising further, the Bank of Japan's \"tankan\" survey showed, offering relief to policy-makers keen to jump-start the economy. The Nikkei share average rose 0.5 percent to 20,329.32. The broader Topix gained 0.4 percent to 1,636.41 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 climbed 0.3 percent to 14,764.55.
