That’s in contrast to before ECB President Mario Draghi announced quantitative easing in January, when the measure jumped to the highest in more than a year.\nBund Futures Volatility Falls\n“If there are people out there who think Draghi will provide a clear hint” on extending QE, “they will be disappointed,” said Martin van Vliet, ING Groep NV’s senior interest-rate strategist in Amsterdam.\nECB officials have given mixed messages about the prospects of more QE this week.\nEwald Nowotny said Thursday inflation is “clearly” undershooting the central bank’s targets, which some took as a sign the chance of new measures is increasing. It’s too early to discuss more QE, his colleague Benoit Coeure said in an interview on CNBC broadcast Monday.\nThe measure of anticipated price swings in bund futures 60 days from now fell to 5.1 percent as of the market close at 5 p.m. London time on Friday, the lowest since Aug. 7. The gauge jumped to 6.6 percent on Jan. 21, the highest since 2013.\nEuropean bonds rose in the week. The yield on Germany’s 10-year securities dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 0.55 percent, while Spain’s slipped six basis points to 1.77 percent.",

        "text_full": "Volatility Drop in Euro Bonds Suggests Investor Caution About QE\nMarket observers assuming this week’s bond rally reflects confidence the European Central Bank will expand monetary stimulus should take a look at volatility.\nImplied price swings on futures for 10-year German bunds fell to a two-month low on Friday, suggesting investors are showing caution by sitting on the sidelines of the market before the bank’s Oct. 22 policy decision. That’s in contrast to before ECB President Mario Draghi announced quantitative easing in January, when the measure jumped to the highest in more than a year.\nBund Futures Volatility Falls\n“If there are people out there who think Draghi will provide a clear hint” on extending QE, “they will be disappointed,” said Martin van Vliet, ING Groep NV’s senior interest-rate strategist in Amsterdam.\nECB officials have given mixed messages about the prospects of more QE this week.\nEwald Nowotny said Thursday inflation is “clearly” undershooting the central bank’s targets, which some took as a sign the chance of new measures is increasing. It’s too early to discuss more QE, his colleague Benoit Coeure said in an interview on CNBC broadcast Monday.\nThe measure of anticipated price swings in bund futures 60 days from now fell to 5.1 percent as of the market close at 5 p.m. London time on Friday, the lowest since Aug. 7. The gauge jumped to 6.6 percent on Jan. 21, the highest since 2013.\nEuropean bonds rose in the week. The yield on Germany’s 10-year securities dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 0.55 percent, while Spain’s slipped six basis points to 1.77 percent.",

Dudley said, cautioning that recent data signal growth may be slowing.\n“If the economy performs in line with my forecast, I would favor lifting off later this year. But it’s a forecast. It’s not a commitment,” Dudley told an audience in Washington Thursday, repeating an argument that he used on Friday and noting that “sometimes the forecasts are right, and sometimes the forecasts are wrong.”\nTepid U.S. economic data are clouding the outlook for liftoff this year and Fed governors Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo said earlier this week they favored patience on the timing of the first rate increase since 2006.\nDudley acknowledged that recent data have been subdued, though he said the domestic economy was performing pretty well, even with headwinds including an inventory adjustment and weaker trade.\nEconomy ‘Slowing’ “The recent economic news suggests the economy is slowing, and we have these developments in China and emerging-market economies that could develop in a way” that could come back and hurt the U.S. economy and inflation, Dudley said.\n“When I put it all together, I still see an economy that is growing a bit above trend,”\nhe said.\nFigures on retail sales, producer prices and inventories released this week all were weaker than forecast, suggesting weakness in inflation and third-quarter growth. Those come on the heels of a September jobs report that fell short of estimates.\nInvestors have cut to 30 percent the probability of a rate increase by policy makers’ December meeting, according to pricing in the federal funds futures market. That compares to 60 percent a month ago, assuming the effective funds rate is 0.375 percent after liftoff.\nDudley earlier discussed monetary policy rules like the so-called Taylor Rule at an event at the Brookings Institution and warned they could lead officials to make mistakes because they aren’t forward-looking and they don’t incorporate key forces shaping the economy.",

He added that investors could be seeing the relatively cheap mining stocks as a bargain-hunting opportunity. \nBurberry was the biggest loser on the FTSE, falling 2.4 percent to extend the previous session's slide, as a profit warning late on Thursday from German peer Hugo Boss (Xetra: BOSA.DE - news ) hit Burberry and other luxury goods companies. \nHugo Boss cut its 2015 sales and profit outlook, while price target cuts from brokers on Burberry's shares added further pressure to the British company on Friday, whose shares had already slumped 8.3 percent on Thursday on weak sales growth.

He added that investors could be seeing the relatively cheap mining stocks as a bargain-hunting opportunity. \nBurberry was the biggest loser on the FTSE, falling 2.4 percent to extend the previous session's slide, as a profit warning late on Thursday from German peer Hugo Boss (Xetra: BOSA.DE - news ) hit Burberry and other luxury goods companies. \nHugo Boss cut its 2015 sales and profit outlook, while price target cuts from brokers on Burberry's shares added further pressure to the British company on Friday, whose shares had already slumped 8.3 percent on Thursday on weak sales growth.

Fair Housing Act by engaging in predatory mortgage lending in the Chicago area, a federal judge in that city ruled on Wednesday. \nU.S. District Judge John Lee rejected HSBC's motion to dismiss the March 2014 lawsuit by Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago. \nCook County alleged that several HSBC affiliates used sophisticated algorithms and software to steer thousands of black and Hispanic borrowers into subprime loans they often could not afford, even if they qualified for lower-cost loans. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the process, sometimes known as \"reverse redlining,\" caused a \"downward spiral\" of delinquencies and foreclosures, eroded property taxes and necessitated greater spending to combat urban blight. \n\"The county has alleged a widespread scheme of discriminatory lending which involved all the various defendants,\" Lee wrote. \"This is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\" \nHSBC spokesman Rob Sherman declined to comment. \nU.S. cities including Baltimore, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Memphis and Miami have, with mixed success, accused a variety of banks in lawsuits of biased mortgage lending that harmed residents and prolonged the nation's housing crisis. \nCook County has also sued Wells Fargo (Hanover: NWT.HA - news ) & Co and Bank of America Corp, raising claims similar to those in the HSBC case. \nThose lawsuits are being handled by other federal judges in Chicago. One dismissed the Wells Fargo case in July, but Cook County filed an amended complaint the next month. \nThe case is County of Cook v HSBC North America Holdings Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 14-02031.

        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO Oct 12 The Golden State Warriors basketball team on Monday acquired a 12-acre site in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood where it plans to build a new, 18,000-seat arena for the reigning NBA champs.\nThe waterfront vacant lot was purchased from cloud computing company Salesforce.com Inc for an undisclosed amount.\nThe Warriors' plan is unique in that it would be the only completely privately financed arena or stadium in the United States over the past two decades.\n\"The Warriors are making an unprecedented, $1 billion-plus investment in San Francisco,\" said Rick Welts, president and chief operating officer of the National Basketball Association team based in Oakland, California. \"We're the only sports team in America doing this all with private funds, on private land, with no public subsidy.\"\nLast week UCSF, which operates a hospital complex in the area, voiced its support for the project after the city agreed to a traffic plan that includes $40 million in transit improvements to reduce congestion on game days.\nAlso last week the Mission Bay Citizens Advisory Committee, which was tasked with vetting the Warriors' plans, voted unanimously to endorse it.\nUp next is an environmental review of the project and the property.\nThe Mission Bay Alliance, an opposition group that consists of people affiliated with the hospital, bio science investors and neighborhood groups, said they will continue to battle against the project.\n\"We think we will beat the Warriors in the environmental review process,\" said Sam Singer, a spokesman for the alliance, noting that he has already identified 50 potential environmental problems with the indoor arena.\nHe said his group, which believes the arena will create major traffic problems, is willing to go to the ballot box or the courts to stop it. The group believes a space 11 blocks south of the Mission Bay site is a better location for the arena.\nIf the current proposal wins all necessary approvals, the stadium could be open in time for the 2018-2019 NBA season.\n\"We've been the Bay Area's team for more than 50 years, and this plan keeps us in the Bay Area for the next 50 and beyond,\" the Warriors' Welts said. \"If there were any lingering doubts about our commitment to Mission Bay, purchasing this land should put them to rest. We love this neighborhood; nobody else is getting this land.\" (Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Richard Chang )",

The group believes a space 11 blocks south of the Mission Bay site is a better location for the arena.\nIf the current proposal wins all necessary approvals, the stadium could be open in time for the 2018-2019 NBA season.\n\"We've been the Bay Area's team for more than 50 years, and this plan keeps us in the Bay Area for the next 50 and beyond,\" the Warriors' Welts said. \"If there were any lingering doubts about our commitment to Mission Bay, purchasing this land should put them to rest. We love this neighborhood; nobody else is getting this land.\" (Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Richard Chang )",

The combined entity has annual revenue of 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) and more heft in the market as competition intensifies in Web retailing of luxury goods. Yoox founder Federico Marchetti is the new company’s chief executive officer, while Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet, who was set to be executive chairman, quit last month.\nRichemont, which owns about 50 percent of Yoox Net-a-Porter stock, also gained in early trading. The maker of Cartier watches said earlier full-year profit will be boosted by an accounting gain of 610 million euros to 670 million euros from the transaction, based on Friday’s closing share price.\nShares of the Geneva-based luxury-goods maker rose as much as 4 percent.\nRichemont also said it agreed not to sell a 25 percent stake in the new company during three years.",

It also left the key parameters of its quantitative easing (QE) scheme unchanged but said it would re-examine the policy at its meeting in December.\nECB chief Mario Draghi said falling inflation expectations, driven in part by lower-than-expected demand for oil, had led it to consider a wide variety of possible measures, including a deposit rate cut, to shore up inflation.\nThe ECB's plans have also pushed down returns on bonds and cash, driving investors over to the better returns available from shares.\n\"Draghi's comments mean continuous support for equities from the ECB,\" said Hampstead Capital hedge fund manager Lex Van Dam.\nDenmark's Novozymes, the world's largest industrial enzymes maker, was among Europe's best performers.\nIts shares jumped 10.8 percent as investors expressed relief that the company's results had managed to meet market forecasts, with the stock having slumped in August after it reported disappointing second quarter results.\nFrench spirits group Pernod Ricard rose 5.2 percent after quarterly sales rose more than expected, as a strong U.S. performance offset sluggish China sales.\nPublicis slumped 7 percent, however, after the world's third-biggest advertising agency cut its annual organic growth target to 1 percent from 2.5 percent as quarterly sales slowed.\nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Danilo Masoni; Editing by Catherine Evans)",

It also left the key parameters of its quantitative easing (QE) scheme unchanged but said it would re-examine the policy at its meeting in December.\nECB chief Mario Draghi said falling inflation expectations, driven in part by lower-than-expected demand for oil, had led it to consider a wide variety of possible measures, including a deposit rate cut, to shore up inflation.\nThe ECB's plans have also pushed down returns on bonds and cash, driving investors over to the better returns available from shares.\n\"Draghi's comments mean continuous support for equities from the ECB,\" said Hampstead Capital hedge fund manager Lex Van Dam.\nDenmark's Novozymes, the world's largest industrial enzymes maker, was among Europe's best performers.\nIts shares jumped 10.8 percent as investors expressed relief that the company's results had managed to meet market forecasts, with the stock having slumped in August after it reported disappointing second quarter results.\nFrench spirits group Pernod Ricard rose 5.2 percent after quarterly sales rose more than expected, as a strong U.S. performance offset sluggish China sales.\nPublicis slumped 7 percent, however, after the world's third-biggest advertising agency cut its annual organic growth target to 1 percent from 2.5 percent as quarterly sales slowed.\nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Danilo Masoni; Editing by Catherine Evans)",

President Barack Obama last week said he would pressure Congress to enact legislation that would curb firearms violence after a gunman killed nine people in Oregon.\n“There’s a joke in the firearms industry that President Obama is the world’s best gun salesman and there is data to support increased purchases of firearms heading into the 2008 and 2012 elections,” said Andrea James, an analyst with Dougherty & Co. “Of course, Hillary Clinton is vying for the same job.”\nSmith & Wesson, whose brands also include M&P and Thompson/Center Arms, surged 5.4 percent to $17.49 at 12:49 p.m. New York time, after climbing as much as 5.8 percent, the most intraday since Aug. 28. Sturm Ruger, maker of Ruger American, Gunsite Scout and Hawkeye weapons, increased 2.8 percent to $58.01.\nRetailers that sell firearms also benefited.

The ruling Popular Party secured an absolute majority four years ago but polls show it is running neck and neck with the main opposition Socialist party.",

The ruling Popular Party secured an absolute majority four years ago but polls show it is running neck and neck with the main opposition Socialist party.",

I’m doing that because that forms the base for the next generation.”\nJPMorgan joins banks including Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA and Citigroup Inc. that have added operations in Africa to gain from the continent’s economic growth. Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to grow 3.8 percent this year and 4.3 percent next year, making it one of the fastest-expanding regions, an International Monetary Fund report released Oct. 6 shows.",

That judgment was reiterated by policy makers Kristin Forbes and Ian McCafferty in the past week, with the latter saying there’s little evidence of a negative transmission to Britain.\nKey for investors will be how this view feeds in to the debate about when to begin raising the benchmark interest rate from a record-low 0.5 percent. With inflation below zero, McCafferty is currently the only policy maker voting for an increase, though Forbes has said she favors tightening soon.\n“It’s on the MPC’s watch list, but it’s one of a number of factors,” said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec. “We’re not witnessing anything directly at the moment, but given the interconnectedness of the global economy, there could be second round effects.”\nBOE Governor Mark Carney has previously said he expects the outlook for the key rate to sharpen around the turn of the year, though he hasn’t commented on monetary policy since the MPC’s Oct. 8 decision. He’s due to deliver a speech in Oxford later on Wednesday to coincide with the publication of a BOE report into EU membership and monetary stability.\nNovember Forecasts Countering the relatively upbeat outlook for the economy, economists in the survey also expect the central bank to cut its growth and inflation projections when it publishes new forecasts in November. Almost 60 percent of those surveyed see a reduction in the growth outlook, with 65 percent predicting an inflation downgrade.\nThere’s reason for caution. While U.K. GDP has grown for 10 straight quarters and productivity is finally beginning to pickup, emerging-market risks have increased and domestic surveys point to a slowdown in manufacturing and services in recent months. At the same time, inflation is well below the BOE’s 2 percent goal and officials expect it to stay shy of 1 percent into 2016.",

Poloz said again on Monday that the bar for change is high.\nDuring a question and answer session with the audience, Poloz said that the strengthening of the U.S. economy is \"having the expected effects on Canadian exports.\"\nA pick up in exports is key to the Bank of Canada's view that the economy will regain momentum after being in a mild recession in the first half of the year. While recent data showed exports dipped in August, the sector saw strong growth over the previous two months.\nThe Bank of Canada has cut interest rates twice this year to stave off the economic blow from cheap oil prices, but some have voiced concern that the cheaper borrowing costs will add more fuel to an already hot housing market.\nIn a speech that largely echoed one he gave on Saturday, Poloz justified the rate cuts as being required by the oil price crash cutting into national income and threatening to drive inflation below target for an unacceptably long time.

The index added 4.9 percent this week.\nThe JPX-Nikkei Index 400 climbed 2.4 percent to 13,589.07.\n(Reporting by Joshua Hunt; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",

Diageo presses ahead with wine sale By Ben Martin | Telegraph – 7 hours ago Diageo plc \nThe FTSE 100 drinks company is understood to be exploring a sale of its wine brands, which include Blossom Hill \nDiageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) , the company behind Captain Morgan rum and Smirnoff vodka, is believed to be pressing ahead with a sale of its wine brands, including Blossom Hill, as its under-pressure boss Ivan Menezes continues his sell-off of the group's peripheral businesses. \nAustralian firm Treasury Wine Estates was named as a leading suitor for the FTSE 100 company’s wine business, which also encompasses the Piat d’Or and Rosenblum brands. \nTreasury, which was spun out of Foster's in 2011, is the world’s largest listed wine maker and produces Wolf Blass and Rosemount Estate. \nA disposal would be in keeping with Mr Menezes strategy. Diageo, the owner of Guinness, Baileys and Pimm’s, has offloaded a number of non-core divisions under Mr Menezes, including Scotland’s famous Gleneagles hotel and golf resort three months ago. \nThe Diageo boss, who is fighting to restore investor confidence after two years of stalled growth, hinted in July that the company’s wine brands could be sold , when he said the group would be “active managers of our portfolio” and that wine “is not going to get bigger for us”. \nThe wine business only accounts for 4pc of Diageo’s net sales and has long been considered a prime candidate for disposal. Sky News was first to report that the FTSE 100 giant was stepping up its efforts to sell the brands. \nA spokesman for Diageo said: \"Wine is a small part of our business but it plays an important role. We have no other comment to make.\"",

Diageo presses ahead with wine sale By Ben Martin | Telegraph – 7 hours ago Diageo plc \nThe FTSE 100 drinks company is understood to be exploring a sale of its wine brands, which include Blossom Hill \nDiageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) , the company behind Captain Morgan rum and Smirnoff vodka, is believed to be pressing ahead with a sale of its wine brands, including Blossom Hill, as its under-pressure boss Ivan Menezes continues his sell-off of the group's peripheral businesses. \nAustralian firm Treasury Wine Estates was named as a leading suitor for the FTSE 100 company’s wine business, which also encompasses the Piat d’Or and Rosenblum brands. \nTreasury, which was spun out of Foster's in 2011, is the world’s largest listed wine maker and produces Wolf Blass and Rosemount Estate. \nA disposal would be in keeping with Mr Menezes strategy. Diageo, the owner of Guinness, Baileys and Pimm’s, has offloaded a number of non-core divisions under Mr Menezes, including Scotland’s famous Gleneagles hotel and golf resort three months ago. \nThe Diageo boss, who is fighting to restore investor confidence after two years of stalled growth, hinted in July that the company’s wine brands could be sold , when he said the group would be “active managers of our portfolio” and that wine “is not going to get bigger for us”. \nThe wine business only accounts for 4pc of Diageo’s net sales and has long been considered a prime candidate for disposal. Sky News was first to report that the FTSE 100 giant was stepping up its efforts to sell the brands. \nA spokesman for Diageo said: \"Wine is a small part of our business but it plays an important role. We have no other comment to make.\"",

The portfolio comprises about 115,000 loans that were packaged into a securitization vehicle called Granite.\nThe sale attracted interest from some of the biggest names in global finance with investment banks seeking to earn fees from providing financing to private equity buyers and by arranging asset-backed bonds. U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne plans to sell the mortgages to help pay down the national debt.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. also bid for the home loans with partner CarVal Investors LLC, people familiar with the matter said previously. A third group that included Deutsche Bank AG, Blackstone Group LP and Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC also bid on the assets, the people said.\nPeter Duda, a spokesman for Cerberus at Weber Shandwick, and Morgan Stanley spokesman Hugh Fraser declined to comment. An official at U.K. Asset Resolution , the government body that oversees Granite, wasn’t immediately for available to comment.\n‘Next Phase’ “The next phase, which could include a variety of scenarios from a new securitization to taking over the mortgage business” is where “the money could be made,” said Ruben Van Leeuwen, an analyst at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht.\nNorthern Rock funded almost 50 billion pounds of U.K. mortgages through Granite before being nationalized seven years ago. The Granite bonds crashed in value as the bank succumbed to the first British bank run in 140 years.\nIn the decade to the 2007 bank run, Northern Rock grew rapidly to become the U.K.’s fifth-largest mortgage lender, with assets in excess of 100 billion pounds, according to the U.K. Treasury. The bank relied on wholesale funding and securitization for its expansion, leaving it exposed when markets seized up during the financial crisis.",

The shares dropped.\nThe fresh funds will be used to absorb losses the bank will incur as it reorganizes, the FT said.

It faces tough competition online from Amazon.com Inc and from grocery retailers and dollar stores.\nWal-Mart's stock, which fell 1.2 percent to $63.53 on Friday morning, has lost a quarter of its value this year.\nMcMillon has said he wanted to eliminate bureaucracy and focus on the stores.\n\"There are no cash registers in the office,\" McMillon told analysts in June after the company's annual shareholders' meeting, setting off speculation he was considering cuts.\n\"Our customers are changing, retail is changing and we must change.

The regulator said it has requested more information by a deadline of Nov. 12.\nThe ACCC on Thursday also postponed a final decision on Royal Dutch Shell's $70 billion takeover of BG Group by a week, its second delay for a ruling on that deal, amid a flurry of M&A activity in the global energy sector that ias increased its workload.

The deal faces scepticism from U.S. lawmakers, who can vote it down. \nThe accord includes Australia and Japan among economies worth a combined $28 trillion. \nWhile acknowledging such a pact would inevitably divert some trade and investment away from China, Beijing would assess comprehensively its potential once the official agreements are reached, Gao Hucheng, China's trade minister, said in a interview with state media posted on the ministry's website www.mofcom.gov.cn late on Thursday. \n\"The United States and the TPP members have repeatedly said that TPP does not target China, and it's not intended to deter or exclude China,\" Gao was quoted as saying. \nThe global trade pattern would eventually depend on the shifting structures of global industries and the competitive edge of each nation's products, the minister said. \nGao said China will push forward regional trade blocks such as RCEP, or Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. \nRCEP, which comprises the 10-nation ASEAN club plus six others - China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - is a Beijing-backed trade framework that has gained prominence as an alternative to U.S. plans. \nIf approved, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) pact would cut trade barriers and set common standards from Vietnam to Canada. It would also furnish a legacy-shaping victory for U.S. President Barack Obama and a political win for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has touted TPP as a way to boost growth in an economy checked by a shrinking population. \nThe agreement has also been pitched as a way to counter China's rising economic and political clout in the region. \n(Reporting by Chen Aizhu; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)",

While there are brighter spots like the US and the UK, and some emerging economies like India, overall the latest news is, in our view, more concerning. \n\"With global economic risks rising, Britain can't be immune from what is happening in the global economy. We must expect that while our economy continues to grow faster than most, it will not grow as fast as last year.\" \nThe IMF expects the UK economy to grow by 2.5pc this year , following growth of 2.9pc in 2014. \nMr Osborne claimed that policies implemented by the Conservative government would ensure Britain, which currently has the second highest deficit in the G7, would have the second lowest by 2020. \n\"We'll go from second worse to second best in five years. It's the first time in 14 years that the IMF sees the UK balancing its books,\" said Mr Osborne. \nThe Chancellor also publicly backed Christine (HKSE: 1210-OL.HK - news ) Lagarde for a second term as the head of the International Monetary Fund. \n\"In my view she has skillfully steered the IMF through the big challenges of Greece and the Ukraine and recovery from the Great Recession. Given the risks to the global economy highlighted here, I can think of no one better to lead the IMF,\" he said.",

While there are brighter spots like the US and the UK, and some emerging economies like India, overall the latest news is, in our view, more concerning. \n\"With global economic risks rising, Britain can't be immune from what is happening in the global economy. We must expect that while our economy continues to grow faster than most, it will not grow as fast as last year.\" \nThe IMF expects the UK economy to grow by 2.5pc this year , following growth of 2.9pc in 2014. \nMr Osborne claimed that policies implemented by the Conservative government would ensure Britain, which currently has the second highest deficit in the G7, would have the second lowest by 2020. \n\"We'll go from second worse to second best in five years. It's the first time in 14 years that the IMF sees the UK balancing its books,\" said Mr Osborne. \nThe Chancellor also publicly backed Christine (HKSE: 1210-OL.HK - news ) Lagarde for a second term as the head of the International Monetary Fund. \n\"In my view she has skillfully steered the IMF through the big challenges of Greece and the Ukraine and recovery from the Great Recession. Given the risks to the global economy highlighted here, I can think of no one better to lead the IMF,\" he said.",

Former chief executive of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly , Taurel will take the chair on New Year's day as Moreno, who this month marked ten years on the group's board of directors, steps down. \nTaurel has sat on the board as chairman of the compensation committee at both IBM Corporation and McGraw Hill Financial (NYSE: MHFI - news ) in the US and is currently a senior advisor at global investment bank Moelis & Co and an advisory board member at pharmaceutical firms Takeda Pharmaceutical of Japan and Barcelona-based Almirall .

Learn more... \nFri, Oct 9, 2015, 21:28 BST - UK Markets closed Profit taking leaves oil flat after week's strong rally AFP – 28 minutes ago View Photo \n\nOil edged up in New York and slipped in London as traders booked profits Friday from the week's rally fueled by hopes for oversupply relief from lower US crude production. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in November rose 20 cents to $49.63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. \nBrent North Sea crude for delivery in November, the global benchmark, fell to $52.65 a barrel in London, a loss of 40 cents from Thursday's settlement. \nThe US futures contract had been moving higher above $50 for much of the day before momentum petered out on the Nymex. \n\"We're just seeing a bit of profit taking at the end of a very, very strong week here,\" said Matt Smith of ClipperData. \n\"After quite a strong rally in the last few days, we're running into resistance just at this $50 level.\" \nWTI prices, which stabilized around $45 in September after hitting six-year lows, have been rebounding this month and leaped 9.0 percent over the past five days of trade, while Brent gained 9.4 percent. \nThere was a fresh sign pointing to a brighter outlook for the oversupplied market -- another drop in US exploration activity, according to the Baker Hughes weekly US oil rig count. \nThe number of active rigs fell by nine last week, marking the sixth consecutive weak of declines in the closely watched data. \nThe drilling slowdown appeared to underpin the Department of Energy's report this week of a decline in US crude production in September. \n\"Market sentiment has changed given that we continue to see a decline in the US production and the forecast is for this decline to continue into 2016,\" said Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates.",
