        "text": "Print \nASHGABAT (Reuters) - The four countries planning a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan and India via Afghanistan will in September pick a company to lead construction, paving the way to the start of work on the project, the Turkmen president said on Saturday. \nTurkmenistan, a central Asian nation of 5.5 million, holds the world's fourth-largest natural gas reserves and sees the TAPI pipeline, named after the countries it is designed to cross, as a way of boosting exports. \nIt has won support from the United States but security concerns and costs estimated at $10 billion have caused delays. \n\"At this moment negotiations ... are entering the final stage, a consortium leader will be named in September, after which the implementation of the project will begin,\" President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov said during talks with visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \nA Turkmen government official, who asked not be named, said construction work could start in December. Companies involved in the talks have not been named. \nThe 1,735 km (1,084 mile) pipeline, with a proposed annual capacity of 33 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas, will run more than 700 km across Afghanistan on its way to Pakistan and India, raising questions about the stability of shipments via the chronically unstable country. \nYet the pipeline, to be built in three years, is crucial for Turkmenistan, which is currently dependent on gas exports to China, which buys annually 30 bcm of the fuel. Berdymukhamedov said the pipeline would attract $1 billion in investments to Afghanistan and create 12,000 jobs. \nRussia, which imported more than 40 bcm of Turkmen gas in 2008, will buy no more than 4 bcm this year. Moscow says its development of gas fields elsewhere has made purchases of Turkmen gas unprofitable. \nTurkmenistan's relations with Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom worsened this week after Ashgabat accused it of not paying for gas supplied this year. Gazprom declined comment. \nNeighbouring Iran also buys small volumes of Turkmen gas. \n(Reporting by Marat Gurt; Writing by Dmitry Solovyov; Editing by David Holmes)",

It added that, at the moment, there was no certainty that the discussions would result in a transaction. \nExor, which holds controlling stakes in carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and tractor manufacturer CNH Industrial, is looking at diversifying its portfolio away from automotive. \n(Reporting by Francesca Landini; Editing by Catherine Evans) Tax cuts, pensions, childcare, online accounts and beer duty, here's … Related Stock Articles Follow the quotes you care about most.

Gold futures for delivery in August snapped higher by 1.10% to end the day at $1,097 per ounce out on COMEX. \nCentrica (LSE: CNA.L - news ) got a boost after RBC Capital Markets upgraded the stock to 'outperform' from 'underperform' and raised its price target to 320p from 240p, saying it has fundamentally changed its view following deeper analysis of retail operations. \"As a result of attractive financials and Centrica's unique positioning in retail markets, led by the Connected Home, we flip our recommendation to outperform,\" said the analysts from RBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) . \nShares in Merlin Entertainment plunged after it warned full-year earnings would be about half of what it made last year, following a roller-coaster crash at its Alton Towers theme park in June.",

The shutdown has put at risk the bourse's place in global securities indices. \nBanks reopened last Monday and Greece submitted a plan to the European Central Bank last week for an opinion before a decision was made by the Greek finance ministry which would allow the stock market to resume trading as early as Monday.The Athens Stock Exchange official said Greece needed more time to finalize the details which would allow the market to reopen based on ECB's opinion. \n(Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou; Editing by Angus MacSwan; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",

The shutdown has put at risk the bourse's place in global securities indices. \nBanks reopened last Monday and Greece submitted a plan to the European Central Bank last week for an opinion before a decision was made by the Greek finance ministry which would allow the stock market to resume trading as early as Monday.The Athens Stock Exchange official said Greece needed more time to finalize the details which would allow the market to reopen based on ECB's opinion. \n(Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou; Editing by Angus MacSwan; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",

The company has developed technology that uses titanium wire to make components at a cost up to 70 percent less than current technologies, in about 10 percent of the time, while wasting less titanium.\nBoley said the project involved hundreds of millions of dollars of investment over the past seven to eight years. Its goal is to build large-scale components for commercial aircraft. He said launch orders were expected by the first quarter of 2016.\nHe said the company was also talking with Lockheed Martin Corp about building components for its F-35 fighter jet. The vice chairman of NTi's board is Chris Kubasik, a former Lockheed executive and the chief executive of New York-based Seabury Advisory Group, which is also aiding NTi.\n\"We're going to make history,\" Boley said. \"This is part of the next industrial revolution.\"\nProponents of 3D printing or additive manufacturing say it can help aircraft manufacturers cut the cost of parts made from titanium, which costs seven times more than aluminum.\nThe new technology also speeds production, Boley said, noting that it can take up to 75 weeks to get 100 pounds of titanium, while the NTi printer can produce a part in five hours, using a fraction of the titanium.\nBoley said the new NTi facility would open with several dozen large-scale 3D printers, but that number would grow in coming years.\nThe company said it expects the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to certify its \"direct metal deposition\" process by the end of this year, with each specific part to be approved by the individual aircraft manufacturer.\nBoley quit Aerojet Rocketdyne in February amid differences about the company's future with his boss at the time, Scott Seymour.

That compares with the 1.16 trillion-won average of 23 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nSlowing demand for smartphones and computing devices in its key markets, especially China, reduced orders for the chipmaker’s dynamic random access memory chips. Researcher Gartner Inc. this month almost halved its 2015 worldwide semiconductor sales growth forecast to 2.2 percent citing softness in electronic-equipment segments including PCs.\n“Steep price decline of memory chips for personal computers was the biggest culprit,” Jay Yoo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul, said before the earnings announcement. “Demand for PCs will continue to remain tepid throughout the year.”\nApple Inc., SK Hynix’s largest customer, on Tuesday reported sales of 47.5 million iPhones last quarter, missing analysts’ estimates. Apple contributes about 9 percent of the chipmaker’s sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nU.S. competitors have painted a darkening industry outlook, mainly due to weaker demand for PC components. Micron Technology Inc., the biggest U.S. maker of memory chips, last month forecast fiscal fourth-quarter sales that fell short of analysts’ estimates after third-quarter sales fell 3.2 percent.\nSK Hynix’s operating profit for the quarter was 1.38 trillion won, compared with the 1.46 trillion won average of estimates.\nShares of SK Hynix have declined 20 percent this year, compared with a 7.8 percent gain in the benchmark Kospi index.\nThe Korean chipmaker said after the market close on Wednesday it will buy back 22 million shares between July 23 and Oct. 22. The value of the transaction based on the stock’s closing price on Tuesday of 39,050 won would be 859.1 billion won, according to the regulatory filing.",

The loonie extended declines after Canada’s policy makers lowered borrowing costs to stimulate an economy struggling with the declining price of oil, its major export. The Australian currency also reached a six-year nadir on Wednesday.\n“We could see further easing from all three central banks,” Bipan Rai, director of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World Markets unit, said by phone from Toronto, referring to Australia, New Zealand and Canada. “The signals we’re getting from global demand just aren’t the same as they were in the heyday for commodity exporters.”\nNew Zealand’s dollar was at 65.64 cents as of 9:16 a.m. Tokyo time. Canada’s dollar, known as the loonie for the image of an aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, slid 0.1 percent to C$1.2931 per greenback, after reaching as weak as C$1.2958 on Wednesday.\nAustralia’s currency lost 0.2 percent to 73.68 U.S. cents.\nWeaker prospects for dairy prices are an economic headwind, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said when it cut rates last month. Data released Thursday showed the country’s inflation held below the RBNZ’s target band for a third quarter.\n“Growth momentum across commodity economies remains weak, and outright growth is likely to slow further,” said Atul Lele, who manages $2 billion as the chief investment officer of Deltec International Group from Nassau, Bahamas. “That may ultimately lead to deleveraging across housing and other asset classes, all necessitating increasing monetary stimulus.”",

The company said Wednesday that it had lined up $143 million of loans through its platform in the second quarter, a 55 percent increase from the first three months of the year. The growth was helped by selling a portfolio of debt to an investment firm.\n“The company is successfully executing on its strategy of diversifying its funding sources,” Mark Palmer, an analyst with BTIG, said in a research note Thursday.\nOnDeck is one of many new companies that seek to use technology to extend credit more efficiently. It went public in December at an initial price of $20 a share. It has come under pressure this year as more companies compete for borrowers.",

        "text_full": "OnDeck Surges After Setting Sales Record on Loan-Portfolio Deal\nOnDeck Capital Inc., which arranges high-cost loans to small businesses over the Internet, surged after selling a record amount of debt in the second quarter.\nThe shares rose 8.5 percent to $14.21 at 10:58 a.m. in New York. The company said Wednesday that it had lined up $143 million of loans through its platform in the second quarter, a 55 percent increase from the first three months of the year. The growth was helped by selling a portfolio of debt to an investment firm.\n“The company is successfully executing on its strategy of diversifying its funding sources,” Mark Palmer, an analyst with BTIG, said in a research note Thursday.\nOnDeck is one of many new companies that seek to use technology to extend credit more efficiently. It went public in December at an initial price of $20 a share. It has come under pressure this year as more companies compete for borrowers.",

Last week a court said the unions were allowed to refuse to service Ryanair flights if the carrier did not meet that demand. \nRyanair said two days later it would re-base its single Copenhagen airplane but then agreed to fresh talks on Wednesday. Local media said the meeting lasted just eight minutes. \n\"Ryanair has sadly flat out refused to enter an agreement with the union and ensure their employees pay and labour terms are in accordance with the Danish labour market,\" said Lizette Risgaard, chairwoman of the trade union umbrella group LO. \n\"That's why LO now issues a second sympathy conflict warning,\" she said in a statement, referring to the action. \nThe statement represents an escalation of the dispute, which has spilled over into the twittersphere after municipalities banned their workers from using the airline for work. Previously the threat had only been for action at Copenhagen. \nRyanair began flying from there in March this year but had been flying for several years out of Billund and Aarhus, both in the west of the country, with no complaints. \nRyanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is unclear whether it had already re-based its Copenhagen workers out of the country and if so, whether the sympathy action would be legal in the capital.

Learn more... \nWed, Jul 8, 2015, 17:17 BST - UK Markets closed Danish unions vow action against Ryanair after talks fail Reuters - UK Focus – 4 minutes 21 seconds ago 11.78 -0.11 \nCOPENHAGEN, July 8 (Reuters) - Danish trade unions have said they would launch action at airports from which Ryanair flies that would effectively stop its services after, they said, the low-cost Irish airline refused to sign up to national collective agreements. \nIn the latest salvo in the months-long dispute, which began before Ryanair even started flying from Copenhagen, the unions said they will refuse services such as refuelling at Copenhagen on July 18 and at two airports in Jutland on July 23. \nThe budget airline's policy of employing people in countries such as Denmark under the less generous terms of its home nation has angered Danish labour unions. \nThe unions wanted the carrier to sign a Danish collective agreement with its locally-based pilots and cabin crew. Last week a court said the unions were allowed to refuse to service Ryanair flights if the carrier did not meet that demand. \nRyanair said two days later it would re-base its single Copenhagen airplane but then agreed to fresh talks on Wednesday. Local media said the meeting lasted just eight minutes. \n\"Ryanair has sadly flat out refused to enter an agreement with the union and ensure their employees pay and labour terms are in accordance with the Danish labour market,\" said Lizette Risgaard, chairwoman of the trade union umbrella group LO. \n\"That's why LO now issues a second sympathy conflict warning,\" she said in a statement, referring to the action. \nThe statement represents an escalation of the dispute, which has spilled over into the twittersphere after municipalities banned their workers from using the airline for work. Previously the threat had only been for action at Copenhagen. \nRyanair began flying from there in March this year but had been flying for several years out of Billund and Aarhus, both in the west of the country, with no complaints. \nRyanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is unclear whether it had already re-based its Copenhagen workers out of the country and if so, whether the sympathy action would be legal in the capital.

Three months ago, the gauge projected a shift in December. The Fed is scheduled to issue the minutes of its June 16-17 meeting Wednesday in Washington.\nAnalysts are pushing back their Fed forecasts as Greece struggles to stay in the euro currency union and as Chinese shares tumble, threatening global economic growth.

The situation helps the Treasury market.”\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. yield fell four basis points to 2.22 percent as of 10:40 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.125 percent note due in May 2025 rose 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 6/32.\nU.S. government debt has returned 0.6 percent in July, after tumbling almost 2 percent during the previous three months, based on the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index.\nUneven U.S. economic growth has also led traders to cut back forecasts for the Fed.

        "text_full": "Fed Looks Set to Postpone Rate Increase Amid Greece Turmoil\nThe Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increase keeps getting postponed.\nThe U.S. central bank probably won’t raise borrowing costs until the first quarter of next year, based on a Morgan Stanley index that tracks expectations for the move. Three months ago, the gauge projected a shift in December. The Fed is scheduled to issue the minutes of its June 16-17 meeting Wednesday in Washington.\nAnalysts are pushing back their Fed forecasts as Greece struggles to stay in the euro currency union and as Chinese shares tumble, threatening global economic growth. Treasuries are climbing in July for the first time in four months as investors seek the relative safety of U.S. debt.\n“Greece has been a headache,” said Park Sungjin, head of investment management in Seoul at Meritz Securities Co., which has $7 billion in assets. “The timing of the Fed rate increase will be postponed. The situation helps the Treasury market.”\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. yield fell four basis points to 2.22 percent as of 10:40 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.125 percent note due in May 2025 rose 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 6/32.\nU.S. government debt has returned 0.6 percent in July, after tumbling almost 2 percent during the previous three months, based on the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index.\nUneven U.S. economic growth has also led traders to cut back forecasts for the Fed. Twelve months ago, the Morgan Stanley Index projected the central bank would increase rates in either June or July of this year.",

Its revenue rose almost 6 percent to C$3.4 billion.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 80 Canadian cents a share, down from 84 cents a year ago.\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Drew McReynolds said the results came in \"slightly above expectations on higher wireless margins while key operating metrics were largely in line,\" in a research note, and suggested a neutral reaction from investors.\nRogers gained 24,000 net postpaid wireless subscribers after two quarters of declines. These customers typically spend much more than those who prepay for service.\nIt also gained 8,000 prepay customers.\nThe company said a rise in postpaid churn, the portion of those valuable customers leaving each month, and a smaller gain in customers than in the year-ago period were expected as the company moves customers off discounted plans and the industry deals with a regulatory move that makes it easier for customers to switch to rivals.\nRogers shed 32,000 cable-TV subscribers and 11,000 landline telephone lines in the period, but gained 4,000 Internet customers.

A deepening slump in commodities and a global stock market rout also reduces the likelihood that the Federal Reserve’s will raise interest rates, contributing to the euro’s strength.\n“In the near term, risk aversion leading to lower U.S. rate hike expectations, and investors cutting short positions in euro may contribute to gains in the currency,” said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Singapore. “Over the long run, the euro is likely to remain in a downtrend owing to its quantitative monetary policy measures. That is unlikely to be changed for the foreseeable future.”\nAnalysts raised this month their end-September forecast for the single currency to $1.08, from $1.04 as recently as in May, according to the median estimate. The euro will extend its decline to $1.05 at the end of the year, analysts predict. The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.1082 on Tuesday at 6:22 a.m. in London.\nThe premium on contracts to sell the single currency over those to buy declined to 23.75 basis points Tuesday, according to data on risk reversals compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest premium since October 2013.\nGreece tapped a 7 billion-euro ($7.8 billion) temporary loan this month to avoid defaulting on the European Central Bank.",

A deepening slump in commodities and a global stock market rout also reduces the likelihood that the Federal Reserve’s will raise interest rates, contributing to the euro’s strength.\n“In the near term, risk aversion leading to lower U.S. rate hike expectations, and investors cutting short positions in euro may contribute to gains in the currency,” said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Singapore. “Over the long run, the euro is likely to remain in a downtrend owing to its quantitative monetary policy measures. That is unlikely to be changed for the foreseeable future.”\nAnalysts raised this month their end-September forecast for the single currency to $1.08, from $1.04 as recently as in May, according to the median estimate. The euro will extend its decline to $1.05 at the end of the year, analysts predict. The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.1082 on Tuesday at 6:22 a.m. in London.\nThe premium on contracts to sell the single currency over those to buy declined to 23.75 basis points Tuesday, according to data on risk reversals compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest premium since October 2013.\nGreece tapped a 7 billion-euro ($7.8 billion) temporary loan this month to avoid defaulting on the European Central Bank.",

Tumbling stocks prices in China and a global drop in commodities added to risk-averse conditions.\n ``The reception at the auction suggests some appetite for the front end,&apos;&apos; said Aaron Kohli , an interest-rate strategist BNP Paribas in New York, one of the 22 primary dealers that are obligated to bid at the auctions. ``A fairly decent three-year auction suggests some confidence from investors there&apos;s not going to be an imminent hike, especially with the backdrop of Greece.&apos;&apos;\n The primary dealers bought 38.4 percent of the of the $24 billion auction, compared with an average of 42.7 percent at the previous 10 auctions.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 3.16, down from 3.33 in June and an average of 3.29 at the 10 previous offerings. The ratio is 2.84 for the entire $1.081 trillion in notes and bonds sold this year, compared with 2.98 in 2014.\n``A lot of investors like to use the auctions as liquidity events, so it&apos;s easier to set a price&apos;&apos; for their purchases, said Neil Bouhan , a fixed-income strategist in the Chicago office of BMO Capital Markets. ``That held up today, so the takeaway is that there&apos;s still a lot of demand, even at richer prices.&apos;&apos;\n The Treasury is scheduled to auction $21 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday and $13 billion of 30-year bonds July 9.",

Tumbling stocks prices in China and a global drop in commodities added to risk-averse conditions.\n ``The reception at the auction suggests some appetite for the front end,&apos;&apos; said Aaron Kohli , an interest-rate strategist BNP Paribas in New York, one of the 22 primary dealers that are obligated to bid at the auctions. ``A fairly decent three-year auction suggests some confidence from investors there&apos;s not going to be an imminent hike, especially with the backdrop of Greece.&apos;&apos;\n The primary dealers bought 38.4 percent of the of the $24 billion auction, compared with an average of 42.7 percent at the previous 10 auctions.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 3.16, down from 3.33 in June and an average of 3.29 at the 10 previous offerings. The ratio is 2.84 for the entire $1.081 trillion in notes and bonds sold this year, compared with 2.98 in 2014.\n``A lot of investors like to use the auctions as liquidity events, so it&apos;s easier to set a price&apos;&apos; for their purchases, said Neil Bouhan , a fixed-income strategist in the Chicago office of BMO Capital Markets. ``That held up today, so the takeaway is that there&apos;s still a lot of demand, even at richer prices.&apos;&apos;\n The Treasury is scheduled to auction $21 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday and $13 billion of 30-year bonds July 9.",

While lenders have limited direct exposure to Greece, their holdings of Italy’s government bonds stood near a record high of 415.5 billion euros ($458.7 billion) in April.\n“The interruption of negotiations between Greece and its international creditors, and the results of last Sunday’s referendum, have had on the whole limited consequences so far on financial markets of the euro area,” Visco said.\nThe spread between Italy’s 10-year BTP and the benchmark German 10-year bund has widened 39 basis points since June 26, the day before the Greek referendum was announced.

Iran signed a previous $3.6 billion credit line with Iran in July 2013 which has been used up mostly for oil imports, bankers have said.\nThe new deal was signed on May 19 and approved by the Syrian parliament on Tuesday, SANA said. The money would be used for funding imports of goods and commodities and implementing projects, it said, without giving details.\nTehran's financial aid has been seen as pivotal to the Syrian government and the economy, which has more than halved in the four years since the conflict erupted, researchers say.\nIran is believed to have sent dozens of military advisers and President Hassan Rouhani has said Tehran will back Assad \"until the end of the road\". Several senior Iranian military figures have been killed in recent months.\nSyrian officials and businessmen said in May last year that Damascus had been negotiating a new credit facility with Iran as the old credit line was being used up.\nSyria's economy has been hurt by depletion of foreign reserves that were estimated at around $16-18 billion before the crisis. The country had been earning some $2.5 billion a year from oil exports before the war. (Reporting by Sylvia Westall and Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Ralph Boulton)",

        "text": "NEW YORK, July 24 Amazon.com founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos got a lot richer while he slept on Thursday night, after the company reported its quarterly earnings and its shares rose 20.1 percent.\nThe stock jump added $8 billion to Bezos' net worth as the market opened on Friday, but by midafternoon, he had given back $3.1 billion of that gain. The shares, which had briefly hit a record high of $580.57 overnight, stabilized near $540.\nIt is all in a day's work - or a night's sleep - for Bezos, who owned 83.92 million shares, or roughly 18 percent of Amazon's outstanding stock of May 14.\nHis stake easily dwarfs those of other insiders. Diego Piacentini, senior vice president of international consumer business, is the second-largest insider holder behind Bezos, with 110,000 shares. Jeffrey Wilke, senior VP of consumer business, owns 80,000 shares.\nThe stake held by Bezos would hold a market cap of about $48.6 billion on its own, which is bigger than S&P 500 names such as FedEx Corp, Caterpillar Inc and Netflix Inc. It is more than 18 times more than the smallest company in the S&P 500 by market cap, Joy Global Inc .\nIt is too soon to tell whether Bezos was up overnight selling some of his highest-priced shares, but an examination of his filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show he has been slowly cutting his stake, mainly by donating stock to charity. He owns roughly 5 percent fewer shares now than his 88.1 million as of Aug. 1, 2011.\nAmazon declined to comment. (Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Linda Stern and Lisa Von Ahn)",

        "text_full": "Amazon.com CEO Bezos up $8 billion, down $3 billion on stock swing\nNEW YORK, July 24 Amazon.com founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos got a lot richer while he slept on Thursday night, after the company reported its quarterly earnings and its shares rose 20.1 percent.\nThe stock jump added $8 billion to Bezos' net worth as the market opened on Friday, but by midafternoon, he had given back $3.1 billion of that gain. The shares, which had briefly hit a record high of $580.57 overnight, stabilized near $540.\nIt is all in a day's work - or a night's sleep - for Bezos, who owned 83.92 million shares, or roughly 18 percent of Amazon's outstanding stock of May 14.\nHis stake easily dwarfs those of other insiders. Diego Piacentini, senior vice president of international consumer business, is the second-largest insider holder behind Bezos, with 110,000 shares. Jeffrey Wilke, senior VP of consumer business, owns 80,000 shares.\nThe stake held by Bezos would hold a market cap of about $48.6 billion on its own, which is bigger than S&P 500 names such as FedEx Corp, Caterpillar Inc and Netflix Inc. It is more than 18 times more than the smallest company in the S&P 500 by market cap, Joy Global Inc .\nIt is too soon to tell whether Bezos was up overnight selling some of his highest-priced shares, but an examination of his filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show he has been slowly cutting his stake, mainly by donating stock to charity. He owns roughly 5 percent fewer shares now than his 88.1 million as of Aug. 1, 2011.\nAmazon declined to comment. (Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Linda Stern and Lisa Von Ahn)",

The share price rose another percent in after-market trades. \nMeanwhile, eBay rose 2.4 percent to $28.57, giving the auction giant a value of some $34 billion at the end of formal trading for the day but the share price slipped slightly to $28.38 after the market closed. \n\"We are excited to celebrate our listing day and embark on our next chapter,? PayPal chief executive Dan Schulman said in a release. \n\"As an independent company, we see a tremendous opportunity for PayPal to expand our role as a champion for consumers and partner to merchants, and to help shape the industry as money becomes digital at an increasingly rapid pace.\" \nAnalysts at BMO Capital Markets said PayPal is a \"unique\" opportunity for investors because it has the potential to disrupt the market for personal and online payments. \nBMO analyst Paul Condra, in a note to clients, called PayPal the \"only truly disruptive consumer payment network with scale and strong brand recognition.\" \nHe said it was \"uniquely positioned not only as a beneficiary of growth in electronic payments but also as a quasi-disruptor of the incumbent card-based systems (MasterCard/Visa (Xetra: A0NC7B - news ) ).\" \nThe spinoff, announced last year, came after months of pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who had assailed eBay for poor management and claimed that keeping eBay tied with PayPal depressed the value of both units. \neBay acquired PayPal in 2002 for roughly $1.5 billion in shares, integrating the payment service that had already been widely used for online auctions. PayPal had traded on the Nasdaq exchange prior to being acquired by eBay.",

Learn more... \nMon, Jul 20, 2015, 23:04 BST - UK Markets closed PayPal jumps in first trades after spinoff AFP – 46 minutes ago View Photo \n\nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in PayPal jumped Monday in the first day after being spun off by eBay, with the online payments group seeing a market value higher than its former parent. \nAt the closing bell on the Nasdaq exchange, PayPal was up 5.42 percent at $40.47, equating to a market capitalization of more than $49 billion. The share price rose another percent in after-market trades. \nMeanwhile, eBay rose 2.4 percent to $28.57, giving the auction giant a value of some $34 billion at the end of formal trading for the day but the share price slipped slightly to $28.38 after the market closed. \n\"We are excited to celebrate our listing day and embark on our next chapter,? PayPal chief executive Dan Schulman said in a release. \n\"As an independent company, we see a tremendous opportunity for PayPal to expand our role as a champion for consumers and partner to merchants, and to help shape the industry as money becomes digital at an increasingly rapid pace.\" \nAnalysts at BMO Capital Markets said PayPal is a \"unique\" opportunity for investors because it has the potential to disrupt the market for personal and online payments. \nBMO analyst Paul Condra, in a note to clients, called PayPal the \"only truly disruptive consumer payment network with scale and strong brand recognition.\" \nHe said it was \"uniquely positioned not only as a beneficiary of growth in electronic payments but also as a quasi-disruptor of the incumbent card-based systems (MasterCard/Visa (Xetra: A0NC7B - news ) ).\" \nThe spinoff, announced last year, came after months of pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who had assailed eBay for poor management and claimed that keeping eBay tied with PayPal depressed the value of both units. \neBay acquired PayPal in 2002 for roughly $1.5 billion in shares, integrating the payment service that had already been widely used for online auctions. PayPal had traded on the Nasdaq exchange prior to being acquired by eBay.",

Axa already has a multibillion-pound black hole in its pension fund. \nStephen Yandle, chairman of Axa UK Pension Trustees said: “This is a very positive step in providing additional security of members’ pensions.” \nThere will be no impact on payments as a result of the deal, he added. \nThe longevity swap means the trustees will pay Reinsurance Group of America an annual premium based on a model of how long scheme members are expected to live. The US company will then pay pensions, suffering the impact if the calculations underestimate life spans. \nCharles Cowling of JLT Employee Benefits said: \"We will see the number of longevity swap deals increase significantly. An insurer taking on the liabilities of a pension fund is a weight off the mind of many corporates. \n“Rising deficits and liabilities are a major drag on the sponsoring company of a scheme and we're beginning to see their impacts being reflected in share prices. A proactive approach to reducing pension risk is now a well-established route for companies and BT, Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) and Scottish Power have all been recent high profile examples of this type of transaction.”",

Axa already has a multibillion-pound black hole in its pension fund. \nStephen Yandle, chairman of Axa UK Pension Trustees said: “This is a very positive step in providing additional security of members’ pensions.” \nThere will be no impact on payments as a result of the deal, he added. \nThe longevity swap means the trustees will pay Reinsurance Group of America an annual premium based on a model of how long scheme members are expected to live. The US company will then pay pensions, suffering the impact if the calculations underestimate life spans. \nCharles Cowling of JLT Employee Benefits said: \"We will see the number of longevity swap deals increase significantly. An insurer taking on the liabilities of a pension fund is a weight off the mind of many corporates. \n“Rising deficits and liabilities are a major drag on the sponsoring company of a scheme and we're beginning to see their impacts being reflected in share prices. A proactive approach to reducing pension risk is now a well-established route for companies and BT, Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) and Scottish Power have all been recent high profile examples of this type of transaction.”",

Electrolux benefited from increased sales of its premium brands as well as built-in kitchen products.\nThe maker of Frigidaire and AEG appliances reiterated it estimates the North American market for home appliances will grow 3 percent to 5 percent this year while the European market is seen growing 1 percent to 2 percent.\nSales sales increased 19 percent to 31.4 billion kronor in the quarter, compared with the 29.4 billion analysts anticipated. First-quarter growth had been 14 percent.\nElectrolux reiterated it aims to complete the acquisition of the General Electric unit by year-end. The DoJ says the purchase would harm competition by reducing the number of major suppliers of cooking appliances to U.S. home builders to two from three.\n“Electrolux does not agree with the DOJ’s assessment that the acquisition will harm competition and will vigorously contest this effort by the DOJ to oppose the transaction,” McLoughlin said in a statement.",

Electrolux benefited from increased sales of its premium brands as well as built-in kitchen products.\nThe maker of Frigidaire and AEG appliances reiterated it estimates the North American market for home appliances will grow 3 percent to 5 percent this year while the European market is seen growing 1 percent to 2 percent.\nSales sales increased 19 percent to 31.4 billion kronor in the quarter, compared with the 29.4 billion analysts anticipated. First-quarter growth had been 14 percent.\nElectrolux reiterated it aims to complete the acquisition of the General Electric unit by year-end. The DoJ says the purchase would harm competition by reducing the number of major suppliers of cooking appliances to U.S. home builders to two from three.\n“Electrolux does not agree with the DOJ’s assessment that the acquisition will harm competition and will vigorously contest this effort by the DOJ to oppose the transaction,” McLoughlin said in a statement.",

Lawmakers on Wednesday were debating the second such package after approving the first last week. \nOnly after Greece approves the required legislation will the 18 other eurozone leaders start negotiations over a three-year bailout worth up to 86 billion euros, Greece's third rescue programme in five years. \nUntil the package can take effect, the ELA is the only available source of financing for Greek banks and, by extension, the sole financial lifeline preventing the Greek economy from imploding.",

Lawmakers on Wednesday were debating the second such package after approving the first last week. \nOnly after Greece approves the required legislation will the 18 other eurozone leaders start negotiations over a three-year bailout worth up to 86 billion euros, Greece's third rescue programme in five years. \nUntil the package can take effect, the ELA is the only available source of financing for Greek banks and, by extension, the sole financial lifeline preventing the Greek economy from imploding.",

Learn more... \nSun, Jul 19, 2015, 23:43 BST - UK Markets closed 70 years after WWII, Japanese company apologizes to US vets 70 years after World War II, Japanese corporation apologizes to US veterans for forced labor By Andrew Dalton, Associated Press | Associated Press – 29 minutes ago View Photo \nJames Murphy, World War II veteran and prisoner of war, is photographed at his home in Santa Maria, … \nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- A major Japanese corporation gave an unprecedented apology Sunday to a 94-year-old U.S. prisoner of war for using American POWs for forced labor during World War II, nearly 70 years after the war ended. \nAt the solemn ceremony hosted by the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, James Murphy, of Santa Maria, accepted the apology from executives of Mitsubishi Materials in front of a projected image of the U.S. and Japanese flags. \nMurphy, who was forced to work in Mitsubishi copper mines under harsh conditions, called the apology sincere and remorseful. \n\"This is a glorious day,\" Murphy said. \"For 70 years we wanted this.\" \nRabbi Abraham Cooper, an associate dean at the center whose primary focus in the past has been Holocaust education, said he believes the move is unprecedented. \n\"As far as I know, this is a piece of history,\" Cooper told The Associated Press recently. \"It's the first time a major Japanese company has ever made such a gesture. We hope this will spur other companies to join in and do the same.\" \nJapan's government issued a formal apology to American POWs in 2009 and again in 2010. But the dwindling ranks of POWs used as slaves at mines and industrial plants have so far had little luck in getting apologies from the corporations who used them, sometimes under brutal conditions. \nSome 12,000 American prisoners were shipped to Japan and forced to work at more than 50 sites to support imperial Japan's war effort, and about 10 percent died, according to Kinue Tokudome, director of the U.S.-Japan Dialogue on POWs, who has spearheaded the lobbying effort for companies to apologize.",

Learn more... \nSun, Jul 19, 2015, 23:43 BST - UK Markets closed 70 years after WWII, Japanese company apologizes to US vets 70 years after World War II, Japanese corporation apologizes to US veterans for forced labor By Andrew Dalton, Associated Press | Associated Press – 29 minutes ago View Photo \nJames Murphy, World War II veteran and prisoner of war, is photographed at his home in Santa Maria, … \nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- A major Japanese corporation gave an unprecedented apology Sunday to a 94-year-old U.S. prisoner of war for using American POWs for forced labor during World War II, nearly 70 years after the war ended. \nAt the solemn ceremony hosted by the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, James Murphy, of Santa Maria, accepted the apology from executives of Mitsubishi Materials in front of a projected image of the U.S. and Japanese flags. \nMurphy, who was forced to work in Mitsubishi copper mines under harsh conditions, called the apology sincere and remorseful. \n\"This is a glorious day,\" Murphy said. \"For 70 years we wanted this.\" \nRabbi Abraham Cooper, an associate dean at the center whose primary focus in the past has been Holocaust education, said he believes the move is unprecedented. \n\"As far as I know, this is a piece of history,\" Cooper told The Associated Press recently. \"It's the first time a major Japanese company has ever made such a gesture. We hope this will spur other companies to join in and do the same.\" \nJapan's government issued a formal apology to American POWs in 2009 and again in 2010. But the dwindling ranks of POWs used as slaves at mines and industrial plants have so far had little luck in getting apologies from the corporations who used them, sometimes under brutal conditions. \nSome 12,000 American prisoners were shipped to Japan and forced to work at more than 50 sites to support imperial Japan's war effort, and about 10 percent died, according to Kinue Tokudome, director of the U.S.-Japan Dialogue on POWs, who has spearheaded the lobbying effort for companies to apologize.",

        "text": "Europe’s debt markets, reinvigorated by optimism for an end to the Greek crisis, are embracing riskier borrowers.\nFrench glass maker Verallia SA is marketing 660 million euros ($723 million) of bonds in a deal expected to be rated four levels below investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service, according to a person familiar with the matter, who isn’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified.

When lawmakers passed the first bundle of measures last week, more than a quarter of the lawmakers from Syriza, the governing party, rebelled.\n“Those who try to divide Syriza into the good and the bad guys will get no help from us,” Tsakalotos told the parliament in Athens. “Do not bank on divisions in Syriza because you will be soon proven wrong.”\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras is trying to hold together an ad hoc majority long enough to finalize the 86 billion-euro (£93 billion) bailout program that Greece needs to stave off financial collapse and hang on to its membership of the euro region. Abandoned by party hardliners led by former finance chief Yanis Varoufakis, Tsipras is reliant on his political opponents to deliver the measures that creditors have demanded.",

When lawmakers passed the first bundle of measures last week, more than a quarter of the lawmakers from Syriza, the governing party, rebelled.\n“Those who try to divide Syriza into the good and the bad guys will get no help from us,” Tsakalotos told the parliament in Athens. “Do not bank on divisions in Syriza because you will be soon proven wrong.”\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras is trying to hold together an ad hoc majority long enough to finalize the 86 billion-euro (£93 billion) bailout program that Greece needs to stave off financial collapse and hang on to its membership of the euro region. Abandoned by party hardliners led by former finance chief Yanis Varoufakis, Tsipras is reliant on his political opponents to deliver the measures that creditors have demanded.",

A further 7% of 11 to 18-year-olds have received a big phone bill due to accidental in-app purchases. \nThe findings come from a survey by charity Childnet for PhonepayPlus, which said that the young people it spoke to gave several reasons for being caught out by unexpected costs. \nReal money These included not understanding that in-app purchases were 'real money'; accidentally clicking on the purchase; and not realising the payment would go through automatically with stored passwords. \nOne 14-year-old boy explained: \"I just wanted to get this character on a game and I didn't realise that it cost money.\" Another boy said: \"I clicked on it to get one and it was taking forever so I kept clicking on it and ended up spending over £100.\" One girl aged between 11 and 14 told the researches she didn't realise the App Store took money straight out of her parents' bank account.\" And a slightly older girl said: \"Clicked what I thought was to go to next level but it was to buy more lives.\" Downloading apps has become so common that 95% of 11 to 18-year-olds admit to doing so. \nSome 59% had paid for an app and 37% had spent money on an in-app purchase. \nComplacent Edward Timpson, the government's children and families minister, said: \"The internet is a tremendously powerful tool that is changing the way our children learn and stay in touch but we cannot afford to be complacent about the risks – the dangers of the virtual world are no less pressing than those in the real world. \n\"But it isn't just a problem for parents, schools have a role to play too which is why we have put online safety at the heart of the curriculum to ensure children are given the information and tools they need to protect themselves online.\" Moneywise are offering Yahoo readers a free copy of their magazine – simply follow this link!",

A further 7% of 11 to 18-year-olds have received a big phone bill due to accidental in-app purchases. \nThe findings come from a survey by charity Childnet for PhonepayPlus, which said that the young people it spoke to gave several reasons for being caught out by unexpected costs. \nReal money These included not understanding that in-app purchases were 'real money'; accidentally clicking on the purchase; and not realising the payment would go through automatically with stored passwords. \nOne 14-year-old boy explained: \"I just wanted to get this character on a game and I didn't realise that it cost money.\" Another boy said: \"I clicked on it to get one and it was taking forever so I kept clicking on it and ended up spending over £100.\" One girl aged between 11 and 14 told the researches she didn't realise the App Store took money straight out of her parents' bank account.\" And a slightly older girl said: \"Clicked what I thought was to go to next level but it was to buy more lives.\" Downloading apps has become so common that 95% of 11 to 18-year-olds admit to doing so. \nSome 59% had paid for an app and 37% had spent money on an in-app purchase. \nComplacent Edward Timpson, the government's children and families minister, said: \"The internet is a tremendously powerful tool that is changing the way our children learn and stay in touch but we cannot afford to be complacent about the risks – the dangers of the virtual world are no less pressing than those in the real world. \n\"But it isn't just a problem for parents, schools have a role to play too which is why we have put online safety at the heart of the curriculum to ensure children are given the information and tools they need to protect themselves online.\" Moneywise are offering Yahoo readers a free copy of their magazine – simply follow this link!",

Corn is the largest U.S. crop and farmer sales and income are key indicators for machinery purchases. \n“Farm machinery sales should remain pressured,” Karen Ubelhart, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a report Monday. \nThe U.S. soybean outlook also lacks a “bright spot for farm equipment,” she said, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture last week forecast that average soybean prices in the 2015-2016 crop year will fall 8 percent. \nThe seven straight years of growth in equipment sales through 2013 was the longest period of expansion on record, according to Ubelhart, but farmers can now defer purchases after replacing a lot of equipment. \nShares of Deere, the world’s largest maker of farm equipment, have gained 8.8 percent this year. Agco Corp. is up 21 percent. The stocks have climbed partly on investor expectation that 2015 will be a trough year and the industry will rebound in 2016 as crop prices rise, said Brett Wong, a Boston-based analyst for Piper Jaffray Cos. \nWong said he’s skeptical about how long grain prices will rally next year, citing large corn stockpiles and upcoming harvests. Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for William Blair & Co., said in a July 10 report the biggest problem in the North American machinery market continues to be the glut of used equipment. \nSales at Agco and Deere will decline next year, according to the average estimates compiled by Bloomberg. \nKen Golden, a spokesman for Moline, Illinois-based Deere, declined to comment on the outlook for 2016. \nAgco is working to reduce inventories this year and there is still a lot of uncertainty about crop harvests, said Greg Peterson, a spokesman for the Duluth, Georgia-based company. Agco is likely to provide 2016 sales forecast in December, he said.",

The holding is a relic of the time United Spirits was run by flamboyant liquor baron Vijay Mallya. \n\"I think it's a no at this point of time, purely based on the whole negative aura that has been generated,\" said Parth Jindal, son of Sajjan Jindal and the family member who oversees the conglomerate's sports interests. \n\"We don't want our brand to be associated with a league that is so tainted at the moment.\" \n(Editing by Clara Ferreira Marques)",

Voyage time between Portland and southern Alaska should not delay the company's plans to begin drilling off northern Alaska in the Chukchi Sea later this month, Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said.\nShell believes that drilling can proceed while the Fennica is being repaired so long as it does not extend into the undersea zone bearing oil and gas. It plans to build the foundations of wells and do other preparatory work before drilling into that zone.\n\"We do not anticipate any impact on our season as we don't expect to require the vessel until August,\" Smith said.\nThe Fennica is one of two ice management vessels in Shell's fleet of nearly 30 ships it expects to bring to the Chukchi off northern Alaska this summer. It contains the capping stack, or emergency equipment designed to contain a blown-out undersea well, required for the drilling.\nThe gash in the Fennica was the second recent setback to Shell's Arctic ambitions. On June 30, the Interior Department informed Shell that established walrus protections prevent it from drilling two wells simultaneously that are less than 15 miles (24 km) apart, which means the company has to adjust its drilling this year.\nThe Fennica is being repaired in Portland and not in ports in and near Seattle, where two Shell oil rigs had been stored before departing for Alaska, because those facilities are only available for light maintenance, Smith said.\nShell has not drilled in the Arctic since 2012 when after the summer drilling season, an enormous drilling rig it was leasing broke free and grounded. If Shell discovers oil, it could begin producing in 10 or 15 years. After this season, it will have spent about $7 billion on Arctic drilling off Alaska before producing oil.\nThe company needs two minor permits from the Department of Interior before it can start drilling.

The company is owned by Australian miners Rio Tinto Plc (LSE: RIO.L - news ) and BHP Billiton Ltd . \nMore than 100 Native Americans and supporters marched from the White House to the Capitol, where they drummed, sang and performed prayer ceremonies for nearly three hours. \n\"Today is our day. Today is our ceremony. We're not here looking at this Capitol like it's in charge of us,\" said tribe councilman Wendsler Nosie. \nThe caravan has been gathering support at Native American reservations and held a protest in New York on Friday. \nMine supporters tout its expected benefits, including about 3,700 jobs and $60 billion in economic impacts. Nosie called the job estimates inflated. \nProject spokeswoman Jennifer Russo has said the company is committed to involving tribal members and has reached out to address complaints. \nPresident Barack Obama in December approved the exchange of 2,400 acres (970 hectares) deemed sacred to Native Americans and precious to environmentalists. \nThe mine is slated for construction next to the Apache Leap cliffs, a site where Apaches jumped to their death to avoid capture by U.S. troops in the 1870s. \nTribal protesters set up a camp in the area in February. They have refused to leave until the land deal is repealed. \nThe exchange was part of a defense spending bill and supported by Arizona's congressional delegation. \nApache Stronghold plans a second day of protests at the Capitol on Wednesday. \n(Reporting by Lacey Ann Johnson; Editing by Ian Simpson and Peter Cooney)",

Learn more... \nTue, Jul 21, 2015, 20:41 BST - UK Markets closed At U.S. Capitol, Arizona Apaches protest planned copper mine Reuters - UK Focus – 11 minutes ago -1.21 \nBy Lacey Johnson \nWASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - Scores of Native American demonstrators protested at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday against a proposed $6 billion copper mine in Arizona at a site that members of the Apache (NYSE: APA - news ) tribe say is sacred. \nMembers of the San Carlos Apache tribe began a cross-country caravan to Washington this month to persuade Congress to save the area known as the Oak Flat campground near Superior, Arizona. \nThe group of Native Americans, called Apache Stronghold, hopes to get lawmakers to repeal a land exchange that paves the way for the project by Resolution Copper Mining. The company is owned by Australian miners Rio Tinto Plc (LSE: RIO.L - news ) and BHP Billiton Ltd . \nMore than 100 Native Americans and supporters marched from the White House to the Capitol, where they drummed, sang and performed prayer ceremonies for nearly three hours. \n\"Today is our day. Today is our ceremony. We're not here looking at this Capitol like it's in charge of us,\" said tribe councilman Wendsler Nosie. \nThe caravan has been gathering support at Native American reservations and held a protest in New York on Friday. \nMine supporters tout its expected benefits, including about 3,700 jobs and $60 billion in economic impacts. Nosie called the job estimates inflated. \nProject spokeswoman Jennifer Russo has said the company is committed to involving tribal members and has reached out to address complaints. \nPresident Barack Obama in December approved the exchange of 2,400 acres (970 hectares) deemed sacred to Native Americans and precious to environmentalists. \nThe mine is slated for construction next to the Apache Leap cliffs, a site where Apaches jumped to their death to avoid capture by U.S. troops in the 1870s. \nTribal protesters set up a camp in the area in February. They have refused to leave until the land deal is repealed. \nThe exchange was part of a defense spending bill and supported by Arizona's congressional delegation. \nApache Stronghold plans a second day of protests at the Capitol on Wednesday. \n(Reporting by Lacey Ann Johnson; Editing by Ian Simpson and Peter Cooney)",

Bowmanville is about 75 km (47 miles) east of Toronto.\nThe railway said there were no injuries or dangerous goods involved and the cause is under investigation.\nVia, the country's main passenger rail service, said because of the derailment, all of its trains are canceled for the remainder of the day between Toronto and Ottawa, as well as between Toronto and Montreal, in both directions.\nVia said it was arranging alternate transportation for affected passengers. Train services are expected to resume Sunday morning and trains between Montreal and Ottawa are operating normally. (Reporting by Jeffrey Hodgson ; Editing by Alan Crosby)",

        "text": "Jonathan Brook, a New York-based director of institutional credit sales at Janney Montgomery Scott who specialized in fixed-income trading during almost two decades on Wall Street, has died. He was 44.\nHe died on July 3 in Rye, New York, where he lived. The cause was a heart attack that occurred while he was driving home, his wife, Nicole Hazard, said in a telephone interview.\nBrook joined Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery in July 2011, when the investment bank expanded its credit trading and sales group. He sold high-yield debt to hedge funds, according to his LinkedIn page .\nBefore his tenure at Janney Montgomery, Brook had stints at six financial firms. In 2007, he started working at Merrill Lynch & Co., where he directed the global strategic risk group’s proprietary-trading department, leaving three months after Bank of America agreed to buy the firm for $50 billion during the global financial crisis in 2008.\nBrook also held fixed-income positions at the New York office of Vining Sparks IBG, a broker-dealer, and at Redi Markets, a financial services firm. He was a vice president of credit arbitrage at Stamford, Connecticut-based CRT Capital Group, from 2004 through 2006.\n‘Adored’ Family The family described him in an online tribute as “a warm, loving, kind young man, who adored his family and cared for others.”\nJonathan Edward Brook was born on Sept. 26, 1970, in New York.

He was 44.\nHe died on July 3 in Rye, New York, where he lived. The cause was a heart attack that occurred while he was driving home, his wife, Nicole Hazard, said in a telephone interview.\nBrook joined Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery in July 2011, when the investment bank expanded its credit trading and sales group. He sold high-yield debt to hedge funds, according to his LinkedIn page .\nBefore his tenure at Janney Montgomery, Brook had stints at six financial firms. In 2007, he started working at Merrill Lynch & Co., where he directed the global strategic risk group’s proprietary-trading department, leaving three months after Bank of America agreed to buy the firm for $50 billion during the global financial crisis in 2008.\nBrook also held fixed-income positions at the New York office of Vining Sparks IBG, a broker-dealer, and at Redi Markets, a financial services firm. He was a vice president of credit arbitrage at Stamford, Connecticut-based CRT Capital Group, from 2004 through 2006.\n‘Adored’ Family The family described him in an online tribute as “a warm, loving, kind young man, who adored his family and cared for others.”\nJonathan Edward Brook was born on Sept. 26, 1970, in New York. His parents, David Brook, a psychiatrist, and Judith Brook, a psychologist, are on the faculty at New York University’s School of Medicine.\nHe received a bachelor’s degree in history from Amherst College, in Massachusetts, in 1992 and a law degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1996.\nBrook began his career as a bankruptcy lawyer before moving into the distressed and high-yield debt markets.

Lew, the U.S. Treasury secretary, “thought that was a joke,” Schaeuble said.\nThe moment of levity comes from a man at the center of talks that will decide in coming days whether Greece leaves the euro area. In the U.S., Lew is trying to prevent Puerto Rico’s unrelated fiscal crisis from deepening without a federal bailout.\nSchaeuble’s suggestion, though surely in jest, would likely leave Lew with the raw end of the deal.\nPuerto Rico has $72 billion of debt, compared with about 320 billion euros ($353 billion) in Greece. Furthermore, Puerto Rico’s obligations are mostly in the hands of private investors, such as hedge funds Brigade Capital Management and Fir Tree Partners. Greek debt is held by other countries, including Germany, and the European Central Bank, injecting politics into the equation.\nWhile both economies have been shrinking, Puerto Rico’s debt burden is smaller. The commonwealth’s debt, including municipalities and public authorities, represents 69 percent of its gross domestic product, compared with 172 percent of GDP in Greece, according to Standard & Poor’s. Current GDP per capita is $28,900 in Puerto Rico versus $21,300 in Greece.\nStuck With Dollar There are similarities. Neither country has its own monetary policy or currency, so they can’t use devaluation to boost their economies. Greece can at least consider returning to the drachma. Puerto Rico is stuck with the dollar.\nEven if Lew were to take Schaeuble’s offer, it’s not clear whether Puerto Rico would be interested in a switch. Its residents enjoy federal subsidies they get from the mainland, worth about $6 billion a year. The island’s non-voting representative in Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, earlier this year introduced legislation that would make the ties even stronger, opening a path for turning the island into a U.S. state.",

Part-time work fell 71,200 while full-time rose 64,800. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected employment would fall by 10,000 and the jobless rate would rise to 6.9 percent.\nJune’s employment drop comes on the heels of other recent data -- a fourth straight month of falling output, the second-largest trade deficit on record -- that build a case for a faltering economy. That may lead Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to cut interest rates for the second time this year on July 15.\nRegionally, Quebec posted the biggest declines, with the loss of 33,300 being the most since May 2005. The province’s unemployment rate rose to 8 percent from 7.6 percent.\nBy industry, the largest drop came from a 16,800 decline in the “other services” category that includes personal and laundry work. Business, building and other support services fell by 13,700 and manufacturing by 7,200 in June.\nThe self-employment category decreased 22,200 and workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees rose 15,900.\nPrivate companies cut 26,300 workers and public-sector employment rose by 42,200 in June.\nGovernor Poloz earlier this year said the shock of a plunge in crude oil prices was “front loaded” and gains in other parts of the economy would take over around the second half of this year. The central bank will update economic forecasts on July 15.",

Part-time work fell 71,200 while full-time rose 64,800. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected employment would fall by 10,000 and the jobless rate would rise to 6.9 percent.\nJune’s employment drop comes on the heels of other recent data -- a fourth straight month of falling output, the second-largest trade deficit on record -- that build a case for a faltering economy. That may lead Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to cut interest rates for the second time this year on July 15.\nRegionally, Quebec posted the biggest declines, with the loss of 33,300 being the most since May 2005. The province’s unemployment rate rose to 8 percent from 7.6 percent.\nBy industry, the largest drop came from a 16,800 decline in the “other services” category that includes personal and laundry work. Business, building and other support services fell by 13,700 and manufacturing by 7,200 in June.\nThe self-employment category decreased 22,200 and workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees rose 15,900.\nPrivate companies cut 26,300 workers and public-sector employment rose by 42,200 in June.\nGovernor Poloz earlier this year said the shock of a plunge in crude oil prices was “front loaded” and gains in other parts of the economy would take over around the second half of this year. The central bank will update economic forecasts on July 15.",

The index breached the average in the last three trading days, and closed lower in the last two.\nStocks fall more often when the S&P 500 is lower than the 200-day average than when it’s higher, Detrick wrote yesterday in a posting on Yahoo! Finance. He based this conclusion on an analysis of the index since 1928, when calculations begin. Yet the Cincinnati-based analyst wrote that the pattern may not hold with this week’s slump for two reasons:\n-- The S&P 500 stayed within 5 percent of its record, set May 21. Stocks did relatively well in the past when the gap was that small, according to data compiled by Detrick. For example, the index rose 79 percent of the time in the next three months and added 4.6 percent on average. For gaps exceeding 5 percent, the figures were 53 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.\n-- The timing of the move. July was the only month in which the S&P 500 had a day-to-day gain on average when it was below the 200-day reading. The 0.05 percent advance contrasted with losses that reached 0.30 percent in other months.\n“Breaking the 200-day so close to new highs might not be such a bearish event,” he wrote. “The fact that it happened in July might also be a plus.”",

        "text": "The private equity industry has changed the most in decades as its investor base evolves and clients demand more fee concessions, Carlyle Group LP’s David Rubenstein said.\n“The industry has changed more in the four or five years since the crisis than in the previous 45 years,” Rubenstein, Carlyle’s co-founder and co-chief executive officer, said Sunday on the television program “Wall Street Week.”\nFrom the 1970s to early 2000s, public pension plans were the biggest investors in the industry, said Rubenstein, who started Washington-based Carlyle in 1987 and has expanded it to manage $193 billion. Private equity firms use the money they collect to buy companies and later sell them for a profit. Today, sovereign-wealth funds are overtaking pensions in allocating money to the firms, of which Carlyle is the second-biggest, he said.\nLarge investors and those who commit early to funds are also able to extract discounts on the fees they pay the buyout firms, Rubenstein said, whereas in the past all clients were charged the same percentage on their committed money.\nIn addition, big clients are increasingly seeking separately managed funds with the firms, rather than solely committing to commingled funds with other investors, he said.\nRetirement Money Rubenstein, 65, said the “great revolution” coming to the industry will be the ability to add non-accredited investors, or those with a net worth lower than $1 million or those earning less than $200,000 a year. Regulations of fund structures should change to allow such people to put some of their retirement savings in private equity vehicles, said Rubenstein.\n“Wall Street Week” is produced by SkyBridge Media, an affiliate of SkyBridge Capital, the fund-of-funds business founded by Anthony Scaramucci. SkyBridge, which sometimes has other business relationships with the show’s participants, advertisers and sponsors, pays Fox stations in key markets to broadcast the show and also streams it online every Sunday at 11 a.m. in New York.",

        "text_full": "Rubenstein Says Private Equity’s Fees, Investors Have Changed\nThe private equity industry has changed the most in decades as its investor base evolves and clients demand more fee concessions, Carlyle Group LP’s David Rubenstein said.\n“The industry has changed more in the four or five years since the crisis than in the previous 45 years,” Rubenstein, Carlyle’s co-founder and co-chief executive officer, said Sunday on the television program “Wall Street Week.”\nFrom the 1970s to early 2000s, public pension plans were the biggest investors in the industry, said Rubenstein, who started Washington-based Carlyle in 1987 and has expanded it to manage $193 billion. Private equity firms use the money they collect to buy companies and later sell them for a profit. Today, sovereign-wealth funds are overtaking pensions in allocating money to the firms, of which Carlyle is the second-biggest, he said.\nLarge investors and those who commit early to funds are also able to extract discounts on the fees they pay the buyout firms, Rubenstein said, whereas in the past all clients were charged the same percentage on their committed money.\nIn addition, big clients are increasingly seeking separately managed funds with the firms, rather than solely committing to commingled funds with other investors, he said.\nRetirement Money Rubenstein, 65, said the “great revolution” coming to the industry will be the ability to add non-accredited investors, or those with a net worth lower than $1 million or those earning less than $200,000 a year. Regulations of fund structures should change to allow such people to put some of their retirement savings in private equity vehicles, said Rubenstein.\n“Wall Street Week” is produced by SkyBridge Media, an affiliate of SkyBridge Capital, the fund-of-funds business founded by Anthony Scaramucci. SkyBridge, which sometimes has other business relationships with the show’s participants, advertisers and sponsors, pays Fox stations in key markets to broadcast the show and also streams it online every Sunday at 11 a.m. in New York.",

The nation&apos;s budget is \"hostage&apos;&apos; to global iron ore prices, with a $10 drop taking up to A$10 billion from forecast revenue, he said.\nThe global iron ore price has dropped more than $12 in the past month, further exposing Australia&apos;s lack of export alternatives.\n\"Australian governments have been operating on the assumption that, once the mining boom passed, low interest rates and a falling dollar would be enough to bring the non-resource sectors dancing out of their graves,\" Charlton, now director of consultancy AlphaBeta , said in a research report. \"Unfortunately, no such resurrection is occurring.\"\n\"Australia watched idly as the rust-belt manufacturing suburbs around Sydney and Melbourne were transformed from red-brick factories into red-hot real estate,&apos;&apos; he said. \"Even some low-income countries like Nepal, Kenya, and Tanzania have greater export diversity than Australia.&apos;&apos;\nHis analysis again raises the question of what Australia will fall back on as the resources tide recedes. Exports have gone backwards as a proportion of the economy over the last 15 years in almost every non-resources industry, and services are now too small to offset mining.\nHis concerns hark back to problems in 1986, when weak international commodity prices led to a collapse in exports, prompting then-Treasurer Paul Keating to warn Australia risked becoming a \"banana republic\" if it failed to change.\n\"If this government cannot get the adjustment, get manufacturing going again, and keep moderate wage outcomes and a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for,&apos;&apos; Keating said in an interview on radio in 1986, after the nation recorded what was then its biggest current account deficit. \"We will end up being a third-rate economy.&apos;&apos;",

The nation&apos;s budget is \"hostage&apos;&apos; to global iron ore prices, with a $10 drop taking up to A$10 billion from forecast revenue, he said.\nThe global iron ore price has dropped more than $12 in the past month, further exposing Australia&apos;s lack of export alternatives.\n\"Australian governments have been operating on the assumption that, once the mining boom passed, low interest rates and a falling dollar would be enough to bring the non-resource sectors dancing out of their graves,\" Charlton, now director of consultancy AlphaBeta , said in a research report. \"Unfortunately, no such resurrection is occurring.\"\n\"Australia watched idly as the rust-belt manufacturing suburbs around Sydney and Melbourne were transformed from red-brick factories into red-hot real estate,&apos;&apos; he said. \"Even some low-income countries like Nepal, Kenya, and Tanzania have greater export diversity than Australia.&apos;&apos;\nHis analysis again raises the question of what Australia will fall back on as the resources tide recedes. Exports have gone backwards as a proportion of the economy over the last 15 years in almost every non-resources industry, and services are now too small to offset mining.\nHis concerns hark back to problems in 1986, when weak international commodity prices led to a collapse in exports, prompting then-Treasurer Paul Keating to warn Australia risked becoming a \"banana republic\" if it failed to change.\n\"If this government cannot get the adjustment, get manufacturing going again, and keep moderate wage outcomes and a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for,&apos;&apos; Keating said in an interview on radio in 1986, after the nation recorded what was then its biggest current account deficit. \"We will end up being a third-rate economy.&apos;&apos;",

We are waiting for them and they have already been announced. They must be fleshed out now. That's the issue for tonight.\" \n(Reporting by Julia Fioretti; Editing by Alastair Macdonald) Follow the quotes you care about most.
