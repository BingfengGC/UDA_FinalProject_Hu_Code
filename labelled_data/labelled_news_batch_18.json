Learn more... \nWed, Sep 16, 2015, 08:21 BST - UK Markets close in 8 hrs 9 mins Palo Alto software company 'Grexit' opts for name change By Lauren Davidson | Telegraph – 1 hour 51 minutes ago Print \nFollowing heightened concerns this summer that Greece and the eurozone could part ways, a Silicon Valley software firm is changing its name to Hiver \nAn unlikely casualty of the Greek debt crisis is the Palo Alto-based software company that has decided to ditch its unfortunate name . \nGrexIt, a business tool for using Gmail, is rebranding as Hiver following \"extraneous circumstances, totally out of our control\". \nThe term Grexit used to refer to the possibility of Greece's exit from the eurozone surged in popularity this summer as it seemed ever more likely that Greece and the single currency bloc could part ways. \nIn a blog post seen by the Telegraph, the software solutions firm said its name, which was chosen in 2011 from the Latin word for crowd or flock, grex, had \"seemed to be an excellent name\" for a company that helped teams collaborate better on email. \nAfter CitiGroup analysts attached the phrase to the Greek crisis in 2012, the Silicon Valley company saw a bump in its web traffic and, along with it, an increase in its bounce rates, or visitors who leave the website immediately. \n\"We learnt to live with it, and factored it into how we analysed our traffic,\" GrexIt said. \"But nothing prepared us for what happened earlier this year.\" \nThis summer, Greece defaulted on a debt repayment to the IMF and the public voted overwhelmingly against austerity bailout conditions , leading to heightened concerns that Greece would be expelled from the eurozone. \nGrexIt said this resulted in more confusion about what it does and created a negative connotation around its name . \nDespite persevering through the summer, the Indian start-up has taken the plunge and changed it name to Hiver, because \"bees are awesome creatures\" that represent \"work ethic, organisation and efficiency\". \nHere's hoping the bees crisis doesn't get any worse.",

Before that, Hanergy had surged more than sixfold within the space of a year.\nShort sellers are to blame for Hanergy’s troubles and are the only beneficiaries of the company’s troubles, Li said, rejecting any notion that he was involved in short sales of Hanergy’s shares.\nShort Sellers “I’ve never been involved in any form of trade of our stock and my team has never been involved either,” Li said. “As the majority shareholder, the group has never cashed in even one cent from our shares and has never sold even one share of our stock.”\nThe maker of thin film solar products, whose surge briefly made it the solar industry’s most valuable company, last month reported its first semi-annual loss since 2011 after suspending contracts with the parent and affiliates.\nHong Kong’s Securities & Futures Commission suspended trading in Hanergy indefinitely, saying the company failed to keep investors properly informed. Li, in the anniversary speech, said the SFC’s reason for the suspension is “unconvincing,” adding that Hanergy is still cooperating with the probe.\nHanergy had promised that by October it would roll out as many as five prototypes for cars powered only by solar panels. So far, the company has yet to make any further announcements.",

Before that, Hanergy had surged more than sixfold within the space of a year.\nShort sellers are to blame for Hanergy’s troubles and are the only beneficiaries of the company’s troubles, Li said, rejecting any notion that he was involved in short sales of Hanergy’s shares.\nShort Sellers “I’ve never been involved in any form of trade of our stock and my team has never been involved either,” Li said. “As the majority shareholder, the group has never cashed in even one cent from our shares and has never sold even one share of our stock.”\nThe maker of thin film solar products, whose surge briefly made it the solar industry’s most valuable company, last month reported its first semi-annual loss since 2011 after suspending contracts with the parent and affiliates.\nHong Kong’s Securities & Futures Commission suspended trading in Hanergy indefinitely, saying the company failed to keep investors properly informed. Li, in the anniversary speech, said the SFC’s reason for the suspension is “unconvincing,” adding that Hanergy is still cooperating with the probe.\nHanergy had promised that by October it would roll out as many as five prototypes for cars powered only by solar panels. So far, the company has yet to make any further announcements.",

        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept 22 Nissan Motor Co CEO Carlos Ghosn said it would be difficult for an automaker to conceal internally an effort to falsify vehicle emissions data, such as has happened at Volkswagen AG.\nThe revelation at VW raises new \"trust\" issues for global automakers in the eyes of consumers, Ghosn told Reuters journalists in New York on Tuesday.\nHe declined to comment specifically on what happened within VW but said that a lot of people likely would know about such an effort within a company.\n\"I don't think you can do something like this hiding in the bushes,\" said Ghosn, who is also CEO of Nissan's alliance partner, Renault SA, as well as chairman of their Russian partner, AvtoVAZ.\nVolkswagen has been caught in a deepening scandal since the news broke Friday.\nIt has prompted questions about whether other automakers around the world may have also tampered with emission equipment on diesel engines to skirt tough U.S. standards.

Volkswagen has said it will record a 6.5 billion euro ($7.3 billion) charge in the third quarter to help cover the costs of the debacle - and that the price tag could rise.\nGhosn said the scandal is a challenge for other global producers, who now face scrutiny over their own practices.

Over time, global equities would be able to recover the bulk of recent their losses, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said in a research note sent to clients albeit with one caveat. \nThe above affirmation rested on their forecasts for corporate earnings panning out. \n\"The key to the outlook for global equities is earnings, with global valuations in line with historical averages, a supportive monetary policy backdrop, and very bearish sentiment, a major hit to EPS is the main risk for the market,\" Barclays went on to say. \nIn turn, company profits hinged on two factors, the rate of growth in the world's gross domestic product and oil prices. \nGlobal GDP would remain above the critical 2.6% threshold through 2016, the broker said, leading to an 8.4% expansion in earnings per share. \nHowever, while analysts had cut their forecasts for oil producers' earnings by $148bn their forecasts for consumers had only been bumped up by $9bn. \n\"This asymmetry leaves scope for an oil 'dividend' whatever happens to oil prices,\" they concluded. \nThe broker said it remained underweight US equities while their largest overweight position was still in Europe ex-UK. \nThey also remained overweight on both Japanese and emerging market stocks (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

Over time, global equities would be able to recover the bulk of recent their losses, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said in a research note sent to clients albeit with one caveat. \nThe above affirmation rested on their forecasts for corporate earnings panning out. \n\"The key to the outlook for global equities is earnings, with global valuations in line with historical averages, a supportive monetary policy backdrop, and very bearish sentiment, a major hit to EPS is the main risk for the market,\" Barclays went on to say. \nIn turn, company profits hinged on two factors, the rate of growth in the world's gross domestic product and oil prices. \nGlobal GDP would remain above the critical 2.6% threshold through 2016, the broker said, leading to an 8.4% expansion in earnings per share. \nHowever, while analysts had cut their forecasts for oil producers' earnings by $148bn their forecasts for consumers had only been bumped up by $9bn. \n\"This asymmetry leaves scope for an oil 'dividend' whatever happens to oil prices,\" they concluded. \nThe broker said it remained underweight US equities while their largest overweight position was still in Europe ex-UK. \nThey also remained overweight on both Japanese and emerging market stocks (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

        "text": "Puerto Rico’s main power provider has asked creditors for two more weeks to negotiate how to restructure $8.3 billion of bonds, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nA forbearance agreement that keeps the discussions private and out of court between the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and bondholders, banks and insurance companies, is set to expire late Friday. The utility, referred to as Prepa, is seeking to extend the pact for an eighth time since talks began over a year ago, according to the two people, who asked for anonymity because the discussions are private.\nPrepa first signed the forbearance in August 2014 with its creditors after the agency used its capital budget to pay for fuel.

        "text_full": "Puerto Rico Utility Said to Ask for Two More Weeks in Debt Talks\nPuerto Rico’s main power provider has asked creditors for two more weeks to negotiate how to restructure $8.3 billion of bonds, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nA forbearance agreement that keeps the discussions private and out of court between the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and bondholders, banks and insurance companies, is set to expire late Friday. The utility, referred to as Prepa, is seeking to extend the pact for an eighth time since talks began over a year ago, according to the two people, who asked for anonymity because the discussions are private.\nPrepa first signed the forbearance in August 2014 with its creditors after the agency used its capital budget to pay for fuel. The utility reached a tentative agreement on Sept. 1 with bondholders including OppenheimerFunds Inc., Franklin Advisers Inc., BlueMountain Capital Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., to take losses of about 15 percent in a debt exchange.\nBond insurers Assured Guaranty Ltd. and MBIA Inc. last week offered a proposal that doesn’t include exchanging insured Prepa debt at a discount, according to a person with direct knowledge of the monoline proposal. That would fit into the tentative plan with forbearing bondholders, the person said, without elaborating.

But it plans to increase it again with the government finances back under control and economy growing faster than anywhere in Europe.\nIt will spend an average of 4.5 billion euros a year until 2021 - compared to the average 3.5 billion spent 2011 and 2014 - on projects ranging from a rail line linking Dublin airport to the city centre and the replacement of ageing schools.\n\"We regard this programme as being within the fiscal space available to us, as being prudent and consistent with the government plan to eliminating borrowing by 2018,\" Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny told reporters, referring to a pledge to deliver a balanced budget in three years time.\nCapital spending reached a peak of 10 billion euros - or over 5 percent of annual economic output - in 2008 before the 'Celtic Tiger' boom years and the period of unsustainable government spending it fuelled ground to a halt.\nSpending on infrastructure was subsequently cut at a sharper pace than spending by government departments and the government said on Tuesday that capital spending would gradually increase from 3.8 billion euros next year to 5.4 billion euros in 2021.\nAlmost a third of the planned spending will go to transport projects, as economic growth and rising employment rates are putting pressure on public transport and increasing traffic in urban areas.\nThe government has until March to call an election, but with opinion polls putting the coalition within striking distance of re-election, members of parliament and party strategists say a November ballot is being considered.\nKenny is more likely to call an election for November than see out his term until early next year, Irish bookmaker Paddy Power said on Tuesday after slashing the odds on an early ballot.

But it plans to increase it again with the government finances back under control and economy growing faster than anywhere in Europe.\nIt will spend an average of 4.5 billion euros a year until 2021 - compared to the average 3.5 billion spent 2011 and 2014 - on projects ranging from a rail line linking Dublin airport to the city centre and the replacement of ageing schools.\n\"We regard this programme as being within the fiscal space available to us, as being prudent and consistent with the government plan to eliminating borrowing by 2018,\" Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny told reporters, referring to a pledge to deliver a balanced budget in three years time.\nCapital spending reached a peak of 10 billion euros - or over 5 percent of annual economic output - in 2008 before the 'Celtic Tiger' boom years and the period of unsustainable government spending it fuelled ground to a halt.\nSpending on infrastructure was subsequently cut at a sharper pace than spending by government departments and the government said on Tuesday that capital spending would gradually increase from 3.8 billion euros next year to 5.4 billion euros in 2021.\nAlmost a third of the planned spending will go to transport projects, as economic growth and rising employment rates are putting pressure on public transport and increasing traffic in urban areas.\nThe government has until March to call an election, but with opinion polls putting the coalition within striking distance of re-election, members of parliament and party strategists say a November ballot is being considered.\nKenny is more likely to call an election for November than see out his term until early next year, Irish bookmaker Paddy Power said on Tuesday after slashing the odds on an early ballot.

Asia accounted for more than half of Manulife's insurance sales in the first quarter of 2015.\nFor Standard Chartered, the sale would mark a further retreat from Hong Kong, after it exited the consumer finance unit last year.

        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept 10 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday he wants the state to raise its minimum wage over the next six years to $15 an hour, the highest of any U.S. state.\nThe proposal calls for the minimum wage in New York City to rise to $15 an hour at the end of 2018 and take effect statewide in July 2021, mirroring a state order signed on Thursday that applies only to the fast-food industry.\nIt would mark a significant hike from New York state's current hourly minimum wage of $8.75, which will increase to $9 an hour on Dec. 31, and faced immediate opposition from business groups that called the hike unrealistic.\nIn contrast with the fast-food increase, which the Democratic governor said could be ordered by the state labor commissioner without legislative approval, Cuomo will need lawmakers' approval for a hike for all industries.\nA Cuomo proposal for a more modest minimum-wage increase was opposed by the Republican-led state Senate earlier this year.\nDemocratic politicians across the United States have made raising minimum wages a top issue over the past few years, but the most dramatic moves have come at the city level.\nThe Seattle suburb of SeaTac has raised the minimum wage for certain workers to $15 and Los Angeles plans to adopt the $15 an hour minimum by 2020. A ballot measure in the District of Columbia to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour is expected to go before voters next year.\nSome business groups said Cuomo's proposed hike was too aggressive.\n\"A precipitous increase that threatens the most vulnerable businesses and employees would not find a lot of supporters in the business community,\" said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City.\nCuomo contended the hike would boost the state's economy.\n\"The families that get that money are going to spend that money,\" he told a labor rally in New York City.\nNew York State Labor Commissioner Mario Musolino on Thursday signed the order making the statewide $15 minimum wage for fast-food workers official following a recommendation by the New York Wage Board in July.\nWashington state currently has the highest statewide minimum wage, at $9.47, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

        "text_full": "New York governor pushes for $15 statewide minimum wage\nNEW YORK, Sept 10 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday he wants the state to raise its minimum wage over the next six years to $15 an hour, the highest of any U.S. state.\nThe proposal calls for the minimum wage in New York City to rise to $15 an hour at the end of 2018 and take effect statewide in July 2021, mirroring a state order signed on Thursday that applies only to the fast-food industry.\nIt would mark a significant hike from New York state's current hourly minimum wage of $8.75, which will increase to $9 an hour on Dec. 31, and faced immediate opposition from business groups that called the hike unrealistic.\nIn contrast with the fast-food increase, which the Democratic governor said could be ordered by the state labor commissioner without legislative approval, Cuomo will need lawmakers' approval for a hike for all industries.\nA Cuomo proposal for a more modest minimum-wage increase was opposed by the Republican-led state Senate earlier this year.\nDemocratic politicians across the United States have made raising minimum wages a top issue over the past few years, but the most dramatic moves have come at the city level.\nThe Seattle suburb of SeaTac has raised the minimum wage for certain workers to $15 and Los Angeles plans to adopt the $15 an hour minimum by 2020. A ballot measure in the District of Columbia to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour is expected to go before voters next year.\nSome business groups said Cuomo's proposed hike was too aggressive.\n\"A precipitous increase that threatens the most vulnerable businesses and employees would not find a lot of supporters in the business community,\" said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City.\nCuomo contended the hike would boost the state's economy.\n\"The families that get that money are going to spend that money,\" he told a labor rally in New York City.\nNew York State Labor Commissioner Mario Musolino on Thursday signed the order making the statewide $15 minimum wage for fast-food workers official following a recommendation by the New York Wage Board in July.\nWashington state currently has the highest statewide minimum wage, at $9.47, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Massachusetts is set to hike its minimum to $11 in 2017. (Reporting by Katie Reilly; Editing by Scott Malone and Eric Beech)",

The $2.5 billion fund is still down 1 percent for the year through Aug. 31, the person said, asking not to be named because the information is private.\nThe Brevan Howard Master Fund, managed by Alan Howard, posted a 1 percent loss in the month to Aug. 28, halving its gain for the year, according to a second person familiar with the matter. The $21.7 billion macro hedge fund declined 0.8 percent last year in its first annual loss since starting in 2003, while BlueCrest Capital International rose 0.1 percent.\nOfficials at the firms, both based in Jersey, declined to comment.\nMany hedge funds were wrong-footed by a stocks rout in the last week of August, which wiped more than $5.7 trillion from equities worldwide, as Chinese policy makers took steps to address concerns over an economic slowdown. The HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, which tracks returns across all strategies, lost 2.2 percent, the biggest decline in almost four years.\nWinton Capital Management lost an estimated 4.3 percent in its $11.8 billion Winton Futures Fund. Cantab Capital Partners, another U.K.-based computer-driven fund, erased gains for the year in its $2.6 billion CCP Quantitative strategy after it slumped 10 percent.",

The $2.5 billion fund is still down 1 percent for the year through Aug. 31, the person said, asking not to be named because the information is private.\nThe Brevan Howard Master Fund, managed by Alan Howard, posted a 1 percent loss in the month to Aug. 28, halving its gain for the year, according to a second person familiar with the matter. The $21.7 billion macro hedge fund declined 0.8 percent last year in its first annual loss since starting in 2003, while BlueCrest Capital International rose 0.1 percent.\nOfficials at the firms, both based in Jersey, declined to comment.\nMany hedge funds were wrong-footed by a stocks rout in the last week of August, which wiped more than $5.7 trillion from equities worldwide, as Chinese policy makers took steps to address concerns over an economic slowdown. The HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, which tracks returns across all strategies, lost 2.2 percent, the biggest decline in almost four years.\nWinton Capital Management lost an estimated 4.3 percent in its $11.8 billion Winton Futures Fund. Cantab Capital Partners, another U.K.-based computer-driven fund, erased gains for the year in its $2.6 billion CCP Quantitative strategy after it slumped 10 percent.",

The party faced a flood of racist emails, phone calls and bomb threats last month after its chairman Sigmar Gabriel denounced a \"mob\" involved in anti-refugee violence in the eastern town of Heidenau.

China's takings jumped 34 percent in the same period.\nWhile foreign films still often top China's box office charts - action flick \"Furious 7\" currently holds the number one spot - Chinese movies have raked in 18 billion yuan so far this year, 60 percent of the total, Xinhua reported SARFT as saying.\nChinese blockbuster \"Monster Hunt\", China's highest-grossing film ever, is also likely to steal the top spot after raking in 2.4 billion yuan since its debut on July 16, Xinhua said.\nChina's box office lure has also led some studios to remove scenes from their films and add characters to help get past censors and appeal more to a Chinese market, stoking concerns of self-censorship.\n($1 = 6.3681 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Sunil Nair)",

The deal is worth $2.5 billion,\" the source told AFP. \nSince his sweeping election victory last May, Modi's government has approved a string of military projects that had stalled under the previous left-leaning Congress government, in part over corruption scandals. \nModi has also worked to shore up regional alliances since he came to power in India, which has a longstanding territorial dispute with China over a remote Himalayan region. \nModi, a hardline nationalist premier, wants to end India's status as the world's number one defence importer by instead manufacturing defence equipment locally. \nHis government has lifted the cap on foreign investment in the defence industry to 49 percent and pushed tie ups between foreign and local companies. \nThe deal comes as Modi heads this week to New York, where he hopes to meet US President Barack Obama ahead of the United Nations General Assembly. \nHe also travels to Silicon Valley on the West Coast, seeking to promote his country as open for business to help revive the Indian economy. \nThe deal for the Apaches was \"hybrid\", with one contract to be signed with Boeing for the helicopters and the other with the US government for its weapons and radars, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.",

The deal is worth $2.5 billion,\" the source told AFP. \nSince his sweeping election victory last May, Modi's government has approved a string of military projects that had stalled under the previous left-leaning Congress government, in part over corruption scandals. \nModi has also worked to shore up regional alliances since he came to power in India, which has a longstanding territorial dispute with China over a remote Himalayan region. \nModi, a hardline nationalist premier, wants to end India's status as the world's number one defence importer by instead manufacturing defence equipment locally. \nHis government has lifted the cap on foreign investment in the defence industry to 49 percent and pushed tie ups between foreign and local companies. \nThe deal comes as Modi heads this week to New York, where he hopes to meet US President Barack Obama ahead of the United Nations General Assembly. \nHe also travels to Silicon Valley on the West Coast, seeking to promote his country as open for business to help revive the Indian economy. \nThe deal for the Apaches was \"hybrid\", with one contract to be signed with Boeing for the helicopters and the other with the US government for its weapons and radars, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.",

The governor was among the majority of officials who voted this month to keep the benchmark at 0.5 percent, with Ian McCafferty maintaining his call for a quarter-point increase.\nWhile reiterating that monetary policy was a matter for the independent central bank, Osborne said talk of removing stimulus was an indication of economic success.\nThe BOE and the U.S. Federal Reserve are getting close to withdrawing the emergency measures put in place to counter the financial crisis, with rate-setters in both countries weighing slow inflation against solid labor-market data.\n“The general signal coming from the Bank of England, the general signal coming from the Federal Reserve, is because the British and American economies have been growing robustly in the last couple of years,” Osborne said. “The exit from very loose monetary policy is going to come.”",

        "text": "Bill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, said he’s a “little more bullish” on stocks than hedge fund manager David Tepper.\nStocks are still “pretty cheap,” Ackman said Friday in an interview with CNBC. He added that this doesn’t apply to energy stocks, which he said he doesn’t invest in.\nAckman’s Pershing Square, which manages $18.5 billion, is known for establishing positions in companies, including Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and the former Allergan Inc., and pushing them to make sweeping changes. The hedge fund typically makes long-term bets that the stocks of those companies will rise.\nPershing Square Holdings Ltd., a closed-end fund that tracks the firm’s main hedge fund, erased gains for the year after slumping 9.2 percent during the global market rout in August. Ackman said Friday that as a long-term investor he wasn’t concerned about the short-term performance of his wagers.\n“I can’t tell you where any of our stocks are going to be at the end of next month,” he said.\nTepper, the founder of $20 billion hedge fund Appaloosa Management, told CNBC Thursday that market expectations for earnings are very high. He recommended investors who are fully invested take money off the table.\nAckman also said he doesn’t expect that Kraft Heinz Co. and 3G Capital would be able to buy snack giant Mondelez International Inc. in the near future. Analysts have been speculating about a possible deal between the companies since Pershing Square revealed last month that it had amassed a stake in Mondelez that was valued at $5.6 billion at the time.",

He added that this doesn’t apply to energy stocks, which he said he doesn’t invest in.\nAckman’s Pershing Square, which manages $18.5 billion, is known for establishing positions in companies, including Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and the former Allergan Inc., and pushing them to make sweeping changes. The hedge fund typically makes long-term bets that the stocks of those companies will rise.\nPershing Square Holdings Ltd., a closed-end fund that tracks the firm’s main hedge fund, erased gains for the year after slumping 9.2 percent during the global market rout in August. Ackman said Friday that as a long-term investor he wasn’t concerned about the short-term performance of his wagers.\n“I can’t tell you where any of our stocks are going to be at the end of next month,” he said.\nTepper, the founder of $20 billion hedge fund Appaloosa Management, told CNBC Thursday that market expectations for earnings are very high. He recommended investors who are fully invested take money off the table.\nAckman also said he doesn’t expect that Kraft Heinz Co. and 3G Capital would be able to buy snack giant Mondelez International Inc. in the near future. Analysts have been speculating about a possible deal between the companies since Pershing Square revealed last month that it had amassed a stake in Mondelez that was valued at $5.6 billion at the time.",

It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) roped in former Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) boss Tom Albanese in September 2013. \nHe is now chief executive of London-listed Vedanta Resources Plc and of the Indian-listed operating company, Vedanta Ltd. \nCarroll, who sits on the board of oil major BP, will join as the chairwoman of Vedanta Resources Holdings Ltd, in an advisory role. \nCarroll was chief executive of Anglo American from March 2007 but announced in October 2012 that she would step down, under pressure from investors unhappy over delays with Anglo's biggest project, a Brazilian iron ore mine, and over a sliding stock price. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) joins at a time when miners across the globe are struggling with commodity prices languishing at historic lows.

Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama did not give further details on exports or output. \nFreeport negotiated a six-month export permit with the Indonesian government on July 27. It is still in talks on new government rules making it compulsory for its exports to be transacted through letters of credit issued by domestic banks. \n(Reporting by Bernadette Christina; Additional reporting by Michael Taylor and Wilda Asmarini in Jakarta; Writing by Michael Taylor; Editing by Richard Pullin)",

Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama did not give further details on exports or output. \nFreeport negotiated a six-month export permit with the Indonesian government on July 27. It is still in talks on new government rules making it compulsory for its exports to be transacted through letters of credit issued by domestic banks. \n(Reporting by Bernadette Christina; Additional reporting by Michael Taylor and Wilda Asmarini in Jakarta; Writing by Michael Taylor; Editing by Richard Pullin)",

        "text": "Print \n(Updates throughout) \nLONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - British banks approved the highest number of mortgages in 18 months in August and net mortgage lending hit a five-year high as Britons made the most of record-low interest rates before an expected rise next year, data showed on Thursday. \nThe British Bankers' Association said its members approved 46,473 home loans in August, the highest number since February 2014. That was up from 46,315 in July and 40,454 a year ago. \nNet mortgage lending was 1.955 billion pounds ($2.98 billion) in cash terms, up from 1.701 billion in July and a level last exceeded in August 2010. \n\"People are putting their money into bricks and mortar while interest rates are low and the timing of a likely rate rise remains uncertain,\" BBA chief economist Richard Woolhouse said. \nThe Bank of England is edging closer to raising interest rates for the first time in more than seven years. \nBut persistently low inflation, a strong pound and problems in emerging markets have delayed expectations for the start of monetary tightening after years of record-low rates. \nBoE Governor Mark Carney has said the decision on when to start the process of monetary normalisation, or tightening, will come into sharper relief around the turn of the year. \nHoward Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the data was further evidence that housing activity was picking up. He expected the trend to continue over the coming months due to stronger earnings growth, higher consumer confidence and low mortgage interest rates. \n\"Higher interest rates are unlikely to have a major dampening impact on housing activity for some time to come, as the Bank of England is stressing that interest rates will only rise gradually and to a limited extent,\" he added. \nThe BBA data do not include lending by Britain's mutually owned building societies, but the figures typically act as a good leading indicator for more comprehensive Bank of England figures typically released around a week later.

        "text_full": "UK net mortgage lending hits 5-year high in August - BBA\nPrint \n(Updates throughout) \nLONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - British banks approved the highest number of mortgages in 18 months in August and net mortgage lending hit a five-year high as Britons made the most of record-low interest rates before an expected rise next year, data showed on Thursday. \nThe British Bankers' Association said its members approved 46,473 home loans in August, the highest number since February 2014. That was up from 46,315 in July and 40,454 a year ago. \nNet mortgage lending was 1.955 billion pounds ($2.98 billion) in cash terms, up from 1.701 billion in July and a level last exceeded in August 2010. \n\"People are putting their money into bricks and mortar while interest rates are low and the timing of a likely rate rise remains uncertain,\" BBA chief economist Richard Woolhouse said. \nThe Bank of England is edging closer to raising interest rates for the first time in more than seven years. \nBut persistently low inflation, a strong pound and problems in emerging markets have delayed expectations for the start of monetary tightening after years of record-low rates. \nBoE Governor Mark Carney has said the decision on when to start the process of monetary normalisation, or tightening, will come into sharper relief around the turn of the year. \nHoward Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the data was further evidence that housing activity was picking up. He expected the trend to continue over the coming months due to stronger earnings growth, higher consumer confidence and low mortgage interest rates. \n\"Higher interest rates are unlikely to have a major dampening impact on housing activity for some time to come, as the Bank of England is stressing that interest rates will only rise gradually and to a limited extent,\" he added. \nThe BBA data do not include lending by Britain's mutually owned building societies, but the figures typically act as a good leading indicator for more comprehensive Bank of England figures typically released around a week later.

US crude-oil production fell for the fifth week in a row, dropping by 83,000 barrels per day to 9.14 million barrels per day. \nThough still high, the decline in US production was seen as potentially easing the global oversupply that has outstripped demand and sent prices diving more than 50 percent since June 2014. \nUS stockpiles at the key Cushing hub sank by 900,000 barrels, to 56.4 million. Meanwhile, US demand for petroleum products rose about four percent from a year ago. \n\"Strong economic data, strong demand for oil products, drop in oil production and drop in Cushing stocks seems to provide support to oil prices so far, despite the 2.57 million increase in US crude stocks,\" said Natixis (Paris: FR0000120685 - news ) analyst Abhishek Deshpande.",

Learn more... \nThu, Sep 10, 2015, 20:53 BST - UK Markets closed Oil prices climb on falling US crude output AFP – 14 minutes ago View Photo \n\nWorld oil (Other OTC: WOGI - news ) prices rose Thursday as investors focused on a decline in US crude production instead of a bigger-than-expected jump in inventories. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October leaped $1.77, or 4.0 percent, to $45.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. \nBrent North Sea crude for delivery in October, the European benchmark, closed at $48.89 a barrel in London, advancing $1.31 (2.8 percent) from Wednesday's settlement. \nBoth futures contracts bounced back from sharp falls on Wednesday as traders expected another increase in US commercial crude-oil inventories. \nIn fact, the Department of Energy's (DoE) weekly petroleum report released Thursday showed a much larger-than expected build in inventories, by 2.6 million barrels to 458.0 million barrels in the week to September 4. \nBut the market seized on the more bullish aspects of the report. US crude-oil production fell for the fifth week in a row, dropping by 83,000 barrels per day to 9.14 million barrels per day. \nThough still high, the decline in US production was seen as potentially easing the global oversupply that has outstripped demand and sent prices diving more than 50 percent since June 2014. \nUS stockpiles at the key Cushing hub sank by 900,000 barrels, to 56.4 million. Meanwhile, US demand for petroleum products rose about four percent from a year ago. \n\"Strong economic data, strong demand for oil products, drop in oil production and drop in Cushing stocks seems to provide support to oil prices so far, despite the 2.57 million increase in US crude stocks,\" said Natixis (Paris: FR0000120685 - news ) analyst Abhishek Deshpande.",

By Jessica Gorst-Williams | Telegraph – 5 hours ago 4.389 +0.629 \nA frustrated 60-something couple, both with good jobs, are flummoxed over Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) ' decisions over their borrowing \nI am 67, semi-retired and self-employed. My wife, aged 64, has a good job. \nWe took out a portable interest-only mortgage in September 2008 for 10 years with Barclays. With house prices buoyant we now wish to sell our current property, worth £360,000, and pay Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) £125,000. \nThen we wish to move the remaining £50,000 of the mortgage to a smaller house. \nHowever, the Barclays adviser tells me that I do not fit into any of its mortgage contract or lending criteria for a new mortgage. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) does not seem to understand that this is not a new mortgage. The adviser then offered my wife a six-year repayment mortgage of £50,000 at about £750 a month. \nWe explained that we did not want another mortgage. PG, bucks \nWhen I contacted Barclays it transpired that, following a recent review of its mortgage procedures and criteria, a new process had been introduced on June 25 for existing customers who apply for a like-for-like transfer of their mortgage. \nThis includes situations where there is no increase in the borrowing or the term, and where all parties to the mortgage remain unchanged. \nThis means it can review your proposition again. A mortgage adviser is contacting you to discuss this further. \n• More investing ideas at facebook.com/telegraphinvesting \n• Put an investing question to our experts: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk",

By Jessica Gorst-Williams | Telegraph – 5 hours ago 4.389 +0.629 \nA frustrated 60-something couple, both with good jobs, are flummoxed over Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) ' decisions over their borrowing \nI am 67, semi-retired and self-employed. My wife, aged 64, has a good job. \nWe took out a portable interest-only mortgage in September 2008 for 10 years with Barclays. With house prices buoyant we now wish to sell our current property, worth £360,000, and pay Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) £125,000. \nThen we wish to move the remaining £50,000 of the mortgage to a smaller house. \nHowever, the Barclays adviser tells me that I do not fit into any of its mortgage contract or lending criteria for a new mortgage. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) does not seem to understand that this is not a new mortgage. The adviser then offered my wife a six-year repayment mortgage of £50,000 at about £750 a month. \nWe explained that we did not want another mortgage. PG, bucks \nWhen I contacted Barclays it transpired that, following a recent review of its mortgage procedures and criteria, a new process had been introduced on June 25 for existing customers who apply for a like-for-like transfer of their mortgage. \nThis includes situations where there is no increase in the borrowing or the term, and where all parties to the mortgage remain unchanged. \nThis means it can review your proposition again. A mortgage adviser is contacting you to discuss this further. \n• More investing ideas at facebook.com/telegraphinvesting \n• Put an investing question to our experts: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk",

Insurers that guarantee $2.5 billion of the utility’s debt balked at extending the talks. The forbearance keeps negotiations outside of court.\nBondholders agreed to extend the forbearance contract to Oct. 1, while fuel-line lenders pushed the expiration deadline to Sept. 25. The agreement was set to expire late Friday night. Prepa will continue negotiations with its bond insurers even without a forbearance agreement, Lisa Donahue, Prepa’s chief restructuring officer, said in a statement Saturday.\n“We are making progress and will continue working towards a consensual resolution that benefits Prepa and all of its stakeholders,” Donahue said in the statement.\nThe Electric Power Authority, bondholders, banks and insurers have repeatedly extended the agreement, which was first signed in August 2014.\nAssured Guaranty Ltd. declined to extend that accord beyond Friday. MBIA Inc. dropped out of the forbearance earlier this month. An MBIA unit that insures Prepa debt filed a petition Thursday to the island’s energy commission, asking it to temporarily add at least 4.2 cents per kilowatt hour to the agency’s base electricity rate so Prepa can repay its bonds, according to a copy of the request provided by the commission.\nThe expiration may imperil the tentative agreement that Prepa and some of its bondholders reached on Sept. 1 that would require investors to take losses of about 15 percent in a debt exchange.",

New CEO Krueger is honing BMW's strategy. \nLast year, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook went to BMW's headquarters and senior Apple executives toured the carmaker's Leipzig factory to learn how it manufactures the i3 electric car, two sources told Reuters. \nThe dialogue between Apple and BMW was interrupted by a leadership change at BMW. In one of his first interviews as chief executive, Krueger said he too supports the idea of exploring partnerships with tech firms. \n\"Fundamentally, both partners need to profit from the cooperation, otherwise it will not last. And both companies need to share the same principles, for example with regard to data security,\" Krueger is quoted as saying in Monday's Sueddeutsche. \nUpon being asked whether BMW had explored manufacturing a car together with Apple, and whether he still sees the company as a potential partner, Krueger said: \"Let me answer in general terms. There is something which makes BMW Group and Apple very similar. Both are companies with strong brands.\" \nBesides the BMW leadership change, the dialogue between the two companies was also interrupted last year because Apple appeared to want to explore developing a passenger car on its own, one of the sources said. \nAlso, BMW is being cautious about sharing its manufacturing know-how because it wants to avoid becoming just a supplier to a software or Internet giant. \n(Reporting by Edward Taylor; editing by David Clarke)",

Learn more... \nWed, Sep 30, 2015, 21:52 BST - UK Markets closed Railway Electrification Work To Restart By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 34 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe electrification of two rail lines, which will lead to quicker journey times for thousands of passengers, is to go ahead after being stopped earlier this year. \nWork on the TransPennine Express Railway between Manchester and York and the Midland Mainline from London to Sheffield was suspended in June. \nThe move came after Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin raised concerns about spiralling costs and missed targets at Network Rail. \nBut he has now announced that work will restart - meaning faster journey times and significantly more capacity between Manchester, Leeds and York. \nThe upgrade is expected to provide capacity for six fast or semi-fast trains per hour, and will take up to 15 minutes off the current journey time - of 75 minutes - between Manchester and York. \nThe project is expected to take seven years to complete. \nThe improvement will mean that by 2022 the whole route from Liverpool to Newcastle (via Manchester, Leeds and York) will be fully electrified. \nAdam Marshall, executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Businesses were furious when these vital rail upgrades were shelved - and they will be delighted to see that work is set to resume. \n\"Network Rail must now demonstrate that it can deliver these upgrades quickly and within budget. \n\"We cannot afford to see any more stop-start infrastructure projects, as every pause and delay hurts business confidence and ultimately, productivity.\" \nSir Peter Hendy, the chairman of Network Rail, is also proposing to recommence the electrification of Midland Mainline including the line north of Bedford to Kettering and Corby by 2019, and the line North of Kettering to Leicester, Derby/Nottingham and Sheffield by 2023. \nCommenting on the announcement Sir Peter said: “The temporary pause in the programme has given us the space to develop a better plan for passengers. \n\"People can expect more services and faster journeys. \n\"We face some difficult challenges, and there is more work still to do, but the Secretary of State’s decision means we can now move forward with our plans to electrify TransPennine and Midland Mainline”.",

Learn more... \nWed, Sep 30, 2015, 21:52 BST - UK Markets closed Railway Electrification Work To Restart By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 34 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe electrification of two rail lines, which will lead to quicker journey times for thousands of passengers, is to go ahead after being stopped earlier this year. \nWork on the TransPennine Express Railway between Manchester and York and the Midland Mainline from London to Sheffield was suspended in June. \nThe move came after Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin raised concerns about spiralling costs and missed targets at Network Rail. \nBut he has now announced that work will restart - meaning faster journey times and significantly more capacity between Manchester, Leeds and York. \nThe upgrade is expected to provide capacity for six fast or semi-fast trains per hour, and will take up to 15 minutes off the current journey time - of 75 minutes - between Manchester and York. \nThe project is expected to take seven years to complete. \nThe improvement will mean that by 2022 the whole route from Liverpool to Newcastle (via Manchester, Leeds and York) will be fully electrified. \nAdam Marshall, executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Businesses were furious when these vital rail upgrades were shelved - and they will be delighted to see that work is set to resume. \n\"Network Rail must now demonstrate that it can deliver these upgrades quickly and within budget. \n\"We cannot afford to see any more stop-start infrastructure projects, as every pause and delay hurts business confidence and ultimately, productivity.\" \nSir Peter Hendy, the chairman of Network Rail, is also proposing to recommence the electrification of Midland Mainline including the line north of Bedford to Kettering and Corby by 2019, and the line North of Kettering to Leicester, Derby/Nottingham and Sheffield by 2023. \nCommenting on the announcement Sir Peter said: “The temporary pause in the programme has given us the space to develop a better plan for passengers. \n\"People can expect more services and faster journeys. \n\"We face some difficult challenges, and there is more work still to do, but the Secretary of State’s decision means we can now move forward with our plans to electrify TransPennine and Midland Mainline”.",

Assets under management were at $992 million as of the end of August, the person said. Quantedge, which started with $3 million in October 2006, increased its assets under management to $1.05 billion at the end of December. Meeshell Koh, a spokesperson for Quantedge, did not immediately have comment on the returns.\nQuantedge, managed by Singapore-based Quantedge Capital Pte, joins other hedge funds relying on computer models that posted losses last month as global markets were rattled by concerns that China’s economy is slowing. Winton Capital Management lost an estimated 4.3 percent in August in its $11.8 billion Winton Futures Fund, the worst month since July 2008, according to a letter sent to investors last week. Cantab Capital Partners erased gains for the year in its $2.6 billion CCP Quantitative strategy after it slumped 10 percent, an investor letter last week showed.\nThe Eurekahedge Global Macro Hedge Fund Index lost 0.8 percent in August, according to the Singapore-based data provider. The index has gained 0.9 percent since the beginning of the year, on track for the lowest return in four years.\nMarkets Plunge The MSCI World Index plummeted 6.8 percent in August, the most in more than three years, while emerging market currencies fell and the Bloomberg USD Emerging Market Corporate Bond Index declined 2 percent, the most in eight months.\nQuantedge Global Fund was founded by former reinsurance pricing actuary Leow Kah Shin and Chua Choong Tze, who had previously taught a course in portfolio management at Singapore Management University.\nThe fund gained 29.4 percent in 2014, and returned an annualized 30 percent between its inception in October 2006 and the end of December, according to data from Eurekahedge Pte.",

Assets under management were at $992 million as of the end of August, the person said. Quantedge, which started with $3 million in October 2006, increased its assets under management to $1.05 billion at the end of December. Meeshell Koh, a spokesperson for Quantedge, did not immediately have comment on the returns.\nQuantedge, managed by Singapore-based Quantedge Capital Pte, joins other hedge funds relying on computer models that posted losses last month as global markets were rattled by concerns that China’s economy is slowing. Winton Capital Management lost an estimated 4.3 percent in August in its $11.8 billion Winton Futures Fund, the worst month since July 2008, according to a letter sent to investors last week. Cantab Capital Partners erased gains for the year in its $2.6 billion CCP Quantitative strategy after it slumped 10 percent, an investor letter last week showed.\nThe Eurekahedge Global Macro Hedge Fund Index lost 0.8 percent in August, according to the Singapore-based data provider. The index has gained 0.9 percent since the beginning of the year, on track for the lowest return in four years.\nMarkets Plunge The MSCI World Index plummeted 6.8 percent in August, the most in more than three years, while emerging market currencies fell and the Bloomberg USD Emerging Market Corporate Bond Index declined 2 percent, the most in eight months.\nQuantedge Global Fund was founded by former reinsurance pricing actuary Leow Kah Shin and Chua Choong Tze, who had previously taught a course in portfolio management at Singapore Management University.\nThe fund gained 29.4 percent in 2014, and returned an annualized 30 percent between its inception in October 2006 and the end of December, according to data from Eurekahedge Pte.",
