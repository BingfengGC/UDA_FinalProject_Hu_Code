They are publicly funded but use private-sector lenders to fund buildings.\nOf the $10.4 billion issued by charter schools, $346.9 million, or 3.3 percent, has defaulted, according to the report by community financing organization the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and Charter School Advisors. That compares to 2.7 percent recorded in a 2012 LISC report by the same author, CSA managing director Wendy Berry.\n\"I don't think it should be concerning to investors if they're looking at schools in the right way,\" said Reena Abraham, LISC's vice president of education programs.\n\"There is tons of growth in this sector. I think they should be asking the same questions that we have been asking around academic performance. A good school will not fail you.\"\nThe data also showed an uptick in the default rate on the basis of the number of schools issuing bonds - with 5 percent of the 818 schools defaulting according to the 2015 report versus 3.8 percent of 583 recorded in 2012.\nThe schools defaulted mainly because the authorizer of the school did not renew their charter due to sub-par academic performance, the report said.\nMichigan's default rate of 12 percent was the highest amongst all states. Michigan was particularly active in issuing charter school bonds in the early years of charter school bond issuance - which began in 1998 - according to the report, when underwriting criteria had not evolved, it said.\nThe high default rate is also due to the state having mostly small, stand-alone schools that were less able to weather Michigan's economic downturn and the associated effects of reduced education funding, the report said.\nThe study also said that some state programs were improving charter schools' access to the bond market with state officials in Colorado, Utah and Texas developing programs to allow charter operators to get enhanced credit ratings.\n(Reporting by Megan Davies; Editing by Andrew Hay)",

        "text": "AbbVie Inc.’s second-quarter sales fell short of analyst expectations as the company’s top drug, the rheumatoid arthritis injection Humira, grew slower than investors had forecast.\nRevenue grew 11 percent to $5.48 billion, short of analysts’ $5.59 billion prediction, the North Chicago, Illinois-based company said Friday in a statement. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates hurt sales by 8.3 percent.\nSecond-quarter earnings excluding one-time items were $1.08 a share Analysts had forecast $1.06 on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nHumira is AbbVie’s biggest product and made up 63 percent of the company’s revenue last year. The drug brought in $3.54 billion, short of the $3.69 billion analysts had estimated. AbbVie is seeking to reduce its reliance on the biotechnology medicine, which will eventually face competition from cheaper versions known as biosimilars. To diversify, it bought Pharmacyclics Inc. for $21 billion in May, gaining a blockbuster cancer therapy that AbbVie thinks could be applied to many more malignancies beyond its current approvals for several types of blood cancer.\nThe drugmaker also has a hepatitis C treatment, Viekira Pak, generated $385 million in sales, compared with an average estimate of $370 million. AbbVie is competing with Gilead Sciences Inc. for a share of the lucrative hepatitis C market.\nAbbVie shares fell 2.2 percent to $69 at 8:02 a.m. in New York, in trading before the market opened. The stock has gained 30 percent in the past year, compared with a 54 percent increase in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index.",

        "text_full": "AbbVie Sales Fall Short of Estimates as Biggest Drug Misses\nAbbVie Inc.’s second-quarter sales fell short of analyst expectations as the company’s top drug, the rheumatoid arthritis injection Humira, grew slower than investors had forecast.\nRevenue grew 11 percent to $5.48 billion, short of analysts’ $5.59 billion prediction, the North Chicago, Illinois-based company said Friday in a statement. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates hurt sales by 8.3 percent.\nSecond-quarter earnings excluding one-time items were $1.08 a share Analysts had forecast $1.06 on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nHumira is AbbVie’s biggest product and made up 63 percent of the company’s revenue last year. The drug brought in $3.54 billion, short of the $3.69 billion analysts had estimated. AbbVie is seeking to reduce its reliance on the biotechnology medicine, which will eventually face competition from cheaper versions known as biosimilars. To diversify, it bought Pharmacyclics Inc. for $21 billion in May, gaining a blockbuster cancer therapy that AbbVie thinks could be applied to many more malignancies beyond its current approvals for several types of blood cancer.\nThe drugmaker also has a hepatitis C treatment, Viekira Pak, generated $385 million in sales, compared with an average estimate of $370 million. AbbVie is competing with Gilead Sciences Inc. for a share of the lucrative hepatitis C market.\nAbbVie shares fell 2.2 percent to $69 at 8:02 a.m. in New York, in trading before the market opened. The stock has gained 30 percent in the past year, compared with a 54 percent increase in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index.",

Adding to commodity investors’ pain is the resurgent dollar, with focus shifting to next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting amid buoyant economic data. U.S. stocks fell for a third day as earnings results from 3M Co. and Caterpillar Inc. disappointed.\n“With the U.S. dollar likely to keep rising as the Fed prepares to raise rates, there’s still some sort of weakness to come in the commodity space,” Angus Gluskie, managing director at White Funds Management Pty in Sydney, who oversees $550 million, said by phone. “The earnings outlook in the U.S. is also somewhat subdued as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. We’re not likely to see a massive rally in the next few months.”\nJapan’s Topix index slid 0.2 percent and South Korea’s Kospi index dropped 0.7 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.4 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped 0.1 percent. Markets in China and Hong Kong have yet to open.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index rose for a sixth day on Thursday, climbing 2.4 percent and sending the benchmark index to its longest stretch of gains since May, as unprecedented government intervention to support equities took root. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland shares traded in Hong Kong advanced 0.9 percent.\nChina Manufacturing A gauge of Chinese manufacturing due Friday may confirm the sector contracted for a fifth straight month in July.\nE-mini futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1 percent. The U.S. equity benchmark index retreated 0.6 percent on Thursday.\nThe earnings season has been spotty for U.S. companies so far, with sluggish demand overseas damping returns for some multinational companies.

Meiji Yasuda agreed to pay $115 a share for Portland, Oregon-based StanCorp, compared with Thursday’s closing price of $76.69. Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Co. paid about $5.5 billion for Protective Life Corp. this year.\n“Japanese insurers including Nippon Life and Dai-Ichi Life are likely acquirers of U.S. life insurance properties,” Sean Dargan, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., said in a note Wednesday. He cited FGL as a possible target.\nFGL’s majority owner HRG Group Inc. said in April it was looking to sell either a part or all of its stake in the life insurer.\nDes Moines, Iowa-based Principal Financial Group Inc., whose second-largest shareholder is Nippon Life Insurance Co., jumped 3.3 percent to $54.25. Torchmark Corp. rose 2.9 percent and Primerica Inc. climbed 1.1 percent.",

It’s the latest sign of how divorced the nation’s $7.5 trillion market has become from economic fundamentals amid unprecedented government intervention to prop up share prices.\n“There is a clear detachment between fundamentals and the movement of stocks on the mainland,” said Gerry Alfonso, a sales trader at Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. in Shanghai. “The poor factory data should have had a bigger impact.”\nProspects for economic expansion and corporate earnings have become almost irrelevant to Chinese equity investors after policy makers ordered government-linked funds to buy shares and gave a state-run finance firm access to more than $480 billion to support the market. The Shanghai Composite has rallied 19 percent from its July 8 low, leaving the gauge on the cusp of a entering a new bull market.\nThe mainland rally on Friday clashed with the reaction from offshore equity markets, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index sinking 1 percent and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index losing 0.7 percent. The Australian dollar and copper prices, both seen as proxies for Chinese growth expectations, retreated at least 0.5 percent.",

It’s the latest sign of how divorced the nation’s $7.5 trillion market has become from economic fundamentals amid unprecedented government intervention to prop up share prices.\n“There is a clear detachment between fundamentals and the movement of stocks on the mainland,” said Gerry Alfonso, a sales trader at Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. in Shanghai. “The poor factory data should have had a bigger impact.”\nProspects for economic expansion and corporate earnings have become almost irrelevant to Chinese equity investors after policy makers ordered government-linked funds to buy shares and gave a state-run finance firm access to more than $480 billion to support the market. The Shanghai Composite has rallied 19 percent from its July 8 low, leaving the gauge on the cusp of a entering a new bull market.\nThe mainland rally on Friday clashed with the reaction from offshore equity markets, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index sinking 1 percent and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index losing 0.7 percent. The Australian dollar and copper prices, both seen as proxies for Chinese growth expectations, retreated at least 0.5 percent.",

In contrast, big summer discounts failed to lift spend on clothing.\" \nVisa Europe said spending fell by a monthly 0.8 percent in June, after a similar-sized decline in May, although the survey compilers said the monthly measure tended to be volatile. \nConsumer morale surged to a more than 15-year high in June as shoppers said they were ready to spend, according to market research company GfK. \nMost economists and the Bank of England expect British economic growth will quicken from the 0.4 percent quarterly expansion seen in the first three months of the year.

        "text_full": "UK consumer spending growth hits five-year high in Q2 - Visa Europe\nPrint \nLONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - British consumer spending recorded the biggest annual increase during the second quarter in five years, according to figures published on Monday based on credit and debit card transactions from Visa Europe. \nConsumer spending rose 1.4 percent on the year in the three months to June, the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2010, Visa Europe said. \nBritain's big-spending consumers have been a big driver of the country's economic upturn over the past couple of years, aided recently by a slow pick-up in wages and low inflation. \n\"Prudent rather than excessive spending looks to be the order of the day, but people are definitely enjoying themselves,\" said Kevin Jenkins, an executive at Visa Europe. \n\"Dining and nights out, leisure trips and cultural treats all saw sharp increases in spending in June. In contrast, big summer discounts failed to lift spend on clothing.\" \nVisa Europe said spending fell by a monthly 0.8 percent in June, after a similar-sized decline in May, although the survey compilers said the monthly measure tended to be volatile. \nConsumer morale surged to a more than 15-year high in June as shoppers said they were ready to spend, according to market research company GfK. \nMost economists and the Bank of England expect British economic growth will quicken from the 0.4 percent quarterly expansion seen in the first three months of the year.

That review will not be published until the end of this year. \nA separate review by law firm Clifford Chance, which was commissioned by RBS, found no evidence the bank set out to defraud small businesses. \nThe latest investigation will have a broader remit, looking more generally at GRG's activities, Reuters claimed.",

That review will not be published until the end of this year. \nA separate review by law firm Clifford Chance, which was commissioned by RBS, found no evidence the bank set out to defraud small businesses. \nThe latest investigation will have a broader remit, looking more generally at GRG's activities, Reuters claimed.",

The minutes underscored the view that a Fed rate hike would likely have to wait until at least September. \n\"Many participants emphasized that, in order to determine that the criteria for beginning policy normalization had been met, they would need additional information indicating that economic growth was strengthening, that labor market conditions were continuing to improve, and that inflation was moving back toward the Committee's objective,\" the minutes said on Wednesday. \nThey added that lifting rates too soon while price pressures remained modest could hurt the Fed's credibility in being able to handle downside shocks to inflation. \nIn its June policy statement, the central bank kept interest rates at near zero, where they have been since December 2008. But the Fed indicated it was on track for at least one and perhaps a second rate increase later this year. \nAt the time of the Fed's two-day meeting in June, Greece had not yet defaulted on its debt, and China's stock market was not yet in free-fall. \nStill, the minutes pointed to a serious concern policymakers have regarding Greece's economic problems, in a sign of how market tumult abroad could derail the Fed's rate hike plans if contagion spreads. \n\"Many participants expressed concern that a failure of Greece and its official creditors to resolve their differences could result in disruptions in financial markets in the euro area, with possible spillover effects on the United States,\" the minutes said.

Exports were 3.020 million barrels a day in June, he said.\n“We are increasing exports every month,” Yassin said. “The figure is a record.”\nIraq, the second-largest OPEC member, is boosting shipments as a global glut driven by a U.S. shale boom prompts producers to pursue strategies to defend market share.

Oil producers in the Kurdish region, including DNO ASA and Genel Energy Plc, are caught in the dispute between the Iraqi central government and the Kurds, and are struggling to extract payments for their oil shipments.\nKurdish Exports The KRG region is exporting 600,000 barrels a day from the Kurdish region and the neighboring Kirkuk area independently from the central government’s oil marketing company, Ali Hussein Balou, an adviser to KRG natural resources minister Ashti Hawrami, said in a phone interview on Monday. The KRG will continue to export crude independently until a deal is reached with the central government, he said.\nIraq’s minority Kurds, who historically have resisted control by Arab-dominated governments in Baghdad, are independently developing oil reserves they say may total 45 billion barrels, equivalent to almost a third of Iraq’s deposits, according to BP Plc data.

Caterpillar's revenues and profits fall on difficult market conditions By Jessica Fino | Sharecast – 53 minutes ago 6.663 -0.005 \n  Construction and mining equipment manufacturer Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT - news ) fell on Thursday after reporting a decline in profits and revenues during the second quarter of the year.

It strengthens GKN Aerospace's market leadership, manufacturing footprint and technology,\" GKN's chief executive Nigel Stein said in a statement. \nReporting its half-year results, GKN said its pretax profit rose 4 percent in the period to 307 million pounds, helped by growth in its auto-parts supply business, and repeated guidance for 2015 to be another year of growth. \n($1 = 0.9035 euros) (Reporting by Sarah Young, Editing by Paul Sandle)",

It strengthens GKN Aerospace's market leadership, manufacturing footprint and technology,\" GKN's chief executive Nigel Stein said in a statement. \nReporting its half-year results, GKN said its pretax profit rose 4 percent in the period to 307 million pounds, helped by growth in its auto-parts supply business, and repeated guidance for 2015 to be another year of growth. \n($1 = 0.9035 euros) (Reporting by Sarah Young, Editing by Paul Sandle)",

        "text": "Once a promising economy and even a destination for refugees from other conflicts, Syria has transformed into the Middle East&apos;s biggest humanitarian and economic disaster of the past 25 years. With violence spreading across the region, attention has shifted from Syria&apos;s civil war that began in 2011.\nHere are four charts showing Syria&apos;s rapid decline.\n1. An economy in tatters The cumulative economic loss since war broke out is equivalent to 229 percent of the country&apos;s 2010 gross domestic product, according to research by the Syrian Center for Policy Research. Energy, manufacturing and agriculture have suffered the most, Chatham House said in a report last month.\n\"Wealth and production infrastructure has been destroyed,&apos;&apos; said Sami Nader, head of the Beirut-based Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs. ``It&apos;s also threatening the economy and social fabrics of border countries, namely Lebanon and Jordan, which don&apos;t have the resources to absorb the large number of refugees.&apos;&apos;\n2. Seeking refuge More than four years of fighting has left about 11 million people as refugees or internally displaced. The impact has been particularly acute on Syria&apos;s youngest generation, hobbling any eventual recovery. In a country where the pre-war literacy rate was about 90 percent, many children are now deprived of an education. More than 11,000 have died, and children make up more than half of the refugee population, according to Save the Children.\n3. Crude no more Before the European Union suspended crude imports in September 2011, Syria produced about 380,000 barrels a day, according to then Oil Minister Sufian Alao. Production has since collapsed, with Islamic State and other militant groups using limited supplies for their own operations.\nFirst quarter oil production averaged 9,486 barrels a day, the state-run SANA news agency cited a report by Syria&apos;s General Establishment for Petroleum as saying.\n4. Deadly nation The death toll is estimated to have passed at least 230,000 as of June. In the region&apos;s modern history, it is eclipsed only by the eight-year Iran-Iraq war that ended in 1988, which is widely estimated to have left a million people dead on both sides.",

        "text_full": "How War Has Destroyed Syria's Economy in Four Charts\nOnce a promising economy and even a destination for refugees from other conflicts, Syria has transformed into the Middle East&apos;s biggest humanitarian and economic disaster of the past 25 years. With violence spreading across the region, attention has shifted from Syria&apos;s civil war that began in 2011.\nHere are four charts showing Syria&apos;s rapid decline.\n1. An economy in tatters The cumulative economic loss since war broke out is equivalent to 229 percent of the country&apos;s 2010 gross domestic product, according to research by the Syrian Center for Policy Research. Energy, manufacturing and agriculture have suffered the most, Chatham House said in a report last month.\n\"Wealth and production infrastructure has been destroyed,&apos;&apos; said Sami Nader, head of the Beirut-based Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs. ``It&apos;s also threatening the economy and social fabrics of border countries, namely Lebanon and Jordan, which don&apos;t have the resources to absorb the large number of refugees.&apos;&apos;\n2. Seeking refuge More than four years of fighting has left about 11 million people as refugees or internally displaced. The impact has been particularly acute on Syria&apos;s youngest generation, hobbling any eventual recovery. In a country where the pre-war literacy rate was about 90 percent, many children are now deprived of an education. More than 11,000 have died, and children make up more than half of the refugee population, according to Save the Children.\n3. Crude no more Before the European Union suspended crude imports in September 2011, Syria produced about 380,000 barrels a day, according to then Oil Minister Sufian Alao. Production has since collapsed, with Islamic State and other militant groups using limited supplies for their own operations.\nFirst quarter oil production averaged 9,486 barrels a day, the state-run SANA news agency cited a report by Syria&apos;s General Establishment for Petroleum as saying.\n4. Deadly nation The death toll is estimated to have passed at least 230,000 as of June. In the region&apos;s modern history, it is eclipsed only by the eight-year Iran-Iraq war that ended in 1988, which is widely estimated to have left a million people dead on both sides.",

The company also agreed to make contingent cash payments of up to $125 million based on the achievement of certain performance milestones.\n“Roxane is highly complementary to our existing U.S. business,” Michael Raya, who heads Hikma in the U.S., said in the statement. “Today we are a market leader in generic injectables. The acquisition of Roxane will significantly strengthen our non-injectables business.”\nClosely held Boehringer Ingelheim said in January that it was exploring strategic options for Roxane Labs, after Bloomberg News reported that the company was working with Morgan Stanley on the process. The unit comprises Roxane Laboratories Inc., and its manufacturing and supply-chain affiliate, Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane Inc.",

The company also agreed to make contingent cash payments of up to $125 million based on the achievement of certain performance milestones.\n“Roxane is highly complementary to our existing U.S. business,” Michael Raya, who heads Hikma in the U.S., said in the statement. “Today we are a market leader in generic injectables. The acquisition of Roxane will significantly strengthen our non-injectables business.”\nClosely held Boehringer Ingelheim said in January that it was exploring strategic options for Roxane Labs, after Bloomberg News reported that the company was working with Morgan Stanley on the process. The unit comprises Roxane Laboratories Inc., and its manufacturing and supply-chain affiliate, Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane Inc.",

        "text": "(Adds details) \nBy Pamela Barbaglia \nLONDON, July 24 (Reuters) - Barclays Plc (LSE: BARC.L - news ) is in exclusive talks to sell its retail banking business in Portugal to Spain's Bankinter, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. \nTwo sources said Barclays had accelerated the sale of its retail businesses in Portugal and Italy as the British bank tries to speed up its turnaround plan under new Chairman John McFarlane. \nThe sources said the talks to sell in Portugal, where Barclays has 85 branches, were more advanced than talks to sell in Italy, where it has 90 branches and has started talks with interested parties. \nBoth businesses, as well as operations in France, are part of Barclays' portfolio of 'non-core' businesses and assets it wants to sell or run down. \nThe Portuguese sale is likely to include its retail and corporate banking business, but exclude Barclays' investment banking and credit card operations in the country, one of the sources said. \nMcFarlane - who fired Chief Executive Antony Jenkins this month - has said he wants to speed up an improvement in Barclays' performance, which includes getting rid of the loss-making European retail banking operations. \nBarclays sold its retail and corporate banking and wealth management business in Spain to CaixaBank (Other OTC: CAIXY - news ) for about 800 million euros ($876 million) in September. The British bank made a loss after tax on the sale of about 500 million pounds. \nThe Portuguese business is expected to be sold at less than the price Barclays holds its assets at, one of the sources said. \nPortugal's banking sector is in a state of flux as authorities try to sell Novo Banco, the third-largest bank in terms of assets, which was born out of last year's state rescue of Banco Espirito Santo. \nBankinter CEO Maria Dolores Dancausa said after results on Thursday the Spanish bank was \"more a buyer than a seller\" when asked if it was an acquisition target.

The British bank made a loss after tax on the sale of about 500 million pounds. \nThe Portuguese business is expected to be sold at less than the price Barclays holds its assets at, one of the sources said. \nPortugal's banking sector is in a state of flux as authorities try to sell Novo Banco, the third-largest bank in terms of assets, which was born out of last year's state rescue of Banco Espirito Santo. \nBankinter CEO Maria Dolores Dancausa said after results on Thursday the Spanish bank was \"more a buyer than a seller\" when asked if it was an acquisition target.

Well-intentioned steps have been taken for a coalition but if we look realistically there are various difficulties,\" he told the pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper in an interview.\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan is seen as favouring early polls, an option that would give the AKP he founded a chance to win back a majority and revive his hopes of furnishing his post with the strong executive powers he seeks.\nKilicdaroglu, despite his scepticism regarding the formation of a coalition, still views this as the best option for political stability.\nHe said a coalition would be a \"very healthy\" way out of the current uncertainty given that an early election was unlikely to give the AKP a mandate strong enough to deal with the country's problems.\nVeteran CHP deputy and former party leader Deniz Baykal reportedly added to scepticism regarding a possible coalition on Thursday, saying the AKP did not want to form a coalition and that an early election was likely in November.\n\"The AK Party does not want to form a government,\" IHA news agency Quote: d him as telling reporters. \"The coalition talks are just theatre. There will be an election in November.\"\nA grand coalition between the centre-right, Islamist-rooted AKP and the centre-left, secular CHP would likely be fragile and factious.

Well-intentioned steps have been taken for a coalition but if we look realistically there are various difficulties,\" he told the pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper in an interview.\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan is seen as favouring early polls, an option that would give the AKP he founded a chance to win back a majority and revive his hopes of furnishing his post with the strong executive powers he seeks.\nKilicdaroglu, despite his scepticism regarding the formation of a coalition, still views this as the best option for political stability.\nHe said a coalition would be a \"very healthy\" way out of the current uncertainty given that an early election was unlikely to give the AKP a mandate strong enough to deal with the country's problems.\nVeteran CHP deputy and former party leader Deniz Baykal reportedly added to scepticism regarding a possible coalition on Thursday, saying the AKP did not want to form a coalition and that an early election was likely in November.\n\"The AK Party does not want to form a government,\" IHA news agency Quote: d him as telling reporters. \"The coalition talks are just theatre. There will be an election in November.\"\nA grand coalition between the centre-right, Islamist-rooted AKP and the centre-left, secular CHP would likely be fragile and factious. But it could help placate jittery foreign investors and revive attempts to settle a Kurdish rebellion in the southeast. (Writing by Daren Butler ; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Clelia Oziel)",

Lender Emirates NBD, down 2.3 percent, was the main drag on the index and the most traded stock. It had risen 10.4 percent last week on strong second-quarter results.\nAir Arabia was one of the few gainers, climbing 1.2 percent. The low-cost carrier, which has yet to post quarterly earnings, may benefit from cheaper oil and fuel.\nAbu Dhabi's market slipped 0.2 percent and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co (TAQA), vulnerable to oil's fresh weakness, tumbled 4.2 percent.\nBrent and U.S. crude futures on Friday posted their fourth straight weekly decline as weak economic data from China and a rise in U.S. oil drilling rigs applied pressure.\nTelecommunications firm Etisalat, however, edged up 0.3 percent after announcing that its board would discuss second-quarter results and the dividend on Tuesday.\nQatar's index edged down 0.2 percent as blue-chip lender Qatar National Bank fell 0.8 percent.\nOman's market was flat, while Kuwait inched up 0.1 percent.

Lender Emirates NBD, down 2.3 percent, was the main drag on the index and the most traded stock. It had risen 10.4 percent last week on strong second-quarter results.\nAir Arabia was one of the few gainers, climbing 1.2 percent. The low-cost carrier, which has yet to post quarterly earnings, may benefit from cheaper oil and fuel.\nAbu Dhabi's market slipped 0.2 percent and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co (TAQA), vulnerable to oil's fresh weakness, tumbled 4.2 percent.\nBrent and U.S. crude futures on Friday posted their fourth straight weekly decline as weak economic data from China and a rise in U.S. oil drilling rigs applied pressure.\nTelecommunications firm Etisalat, however, edged up 0.3 percent after announcing that its board would discuss second-quarter results and the dividend on Tuesday.\nQatar's index edged down 0.2 percent as blue-chip lender Qatar National Bank fell 0.8 percent.\nOman's market was flat, while Kuwait inched up 0.1 percent.

Gas supplies were cut on July 3 and there was no indication when they would resume, he said. \n\"Our plant and other systems are in good health but we've had to shut down due to an unplanned disruption in supplies from the FPSO (floating, production, storage and offloading vessel),\" Yankey said. \nTullow did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe Chinese-built, $750 million Atuabo gas facility in western Ghana processes around 100 million standard cubic feet of gas daily to feed nearby thermal power generators run by the country's main power utility. \nThe plant's construction was a crucial part of a government strategy to ease a chronic energy shortage that has contributed to a slowing of the economy. \nTullow holds a 35.48 percent stake in the Jubilee field. The other stakeholders are the state-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corporation with 13.64 percent, Kosmos Energy (NYSE: KOS - news ) with 24.08 percent, Anadarko Petroleum Corp with 24.08 percent, and Sabre/PetroSA with 2.73 percent.

Then it unexpectedly cut them by 50 basis points in January, saying plummeting oil prices had eased inflation risks while economic growth was rebounding.

It is expected to be in operation by 2021. \nThe companies awarded contracts are Italian cable supplier Prysmian, French cable supplier Nexans and power technology company ABB (NYSE: ABB - news ) , which will deliver the convertor stations. \nThe estimated cost of the project is between 1.5 billion euros and 2 billion euros, shared jointly by Norwegian transmission system operator Statnett and National Grid. \nThe link is aimed at providing additional electricity transmission capacity and it could help bring down electricity prices in both countries, National Grid and Statnett have said previously. \n\"The benefits to both UK and Norway are also huge and when completed the link will deliver low carbon electricity for the UK and also add to security of supply for Norwegian consumers,\" Alan Foster, National Grid's director of European business development, said in a statement on Tuesday. \n($1 = 0.9111 euros) (Reporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by Mark Potter)",

It is expected to be in operation by 2021. \nThe companies awarded contracts are Italian cable supplier Prysmian, French cable supplier Nexans and power technology company ABB (NYSE: ABB - news ) , which will deliver the convertor stations. \nThe estimated cost of the project is between 1.5 billion euros and 2 billion euros, shared jointly by Norwegian transmission system operator Statnett and National Grid. \nThe link is aimed at providing additional electricity transmission capacity and it could help bring down electricity prices in both countries, National Grid and Statnett have said previously. \n\"The benefits to both UK and Norway are also huge and when completed the link will deliver low carbon electricity for the UK and also add to security of supply for Norwegian consumers,\" Alan Foster, National Grid's director of European business development, said in a statement on Tuesday. \n($1 = 0.9111 euros) (Reporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by Mark Potter)",

He has also launched an anti-hunger campaign. \nMexico posted disappointing growth of 1.1 percent in 2013 and 2.1 percent in 2014, well below government forecasts. The administration has lowered the 2015 growth outlook, blaming the drop in global oil prices.",

He has also launched an anti-hunger campaign. \nMexico posted disappointing growth of 1.1 percent in 2013 and 2.1 percent in 2014, well below government forecasts. The administration has lowered the 2015 growth outlook, blaming the drop in global oil prices.",

A team is studying the cause of the accident, the company said.\nVale is reliant on the port and connecting railway, together known as the Nacala Corridor, to reach capacity at its Moatize coal mine in northwest Mozambique.\nVale expects Moatize's production to reach 11 million tonnes of coal per year by mid-2016 and 22 million tonnes by 2017. Current output is around 7 million tonnes.\nA third source said Vale had been experiencing problems with its wash plant at the mine site, an issue that could see it miss its production target for this year. In its statement Vale said the outage was due to scheduled maintenance and that processes were working normally.\nVale's Moatize project has been beset by logistical problems, with the difficulties in building and expanding the Nacala railway and port holding back production increases at the mine.\nThe rail line runs for 900 km (560 miles) through land-locked Malawi to the port of Nacala on the Indian Ocean. Vale had originally said it expected to ship coal from the new port in the first quarter of 2015.\nLast December, it sold a stake in the project to Japanese trader Mitsui & Co Ltd in order to share the cost of getting it up and running. Mitsui bought a stake of just under 15 percent in the mine and 35 percent in the rail and port.

That's going to mean change, and that kind of change is going to be disruptive,\" he told reporters.\n\"I think the serious question that comes out of the market is, what does it mean in terms of China's resolve to continue with the reform program?\"\nLew said the Chinese government will have to balance economic theory with the pace of change they can implement.\n\"I hope for the sake of China's economy and the world economy that they stick to the reform agenda,\" he said.

        "text_full": "China reaction to stock market fall will affect reform -U.S.' Lew\nWASHINGTON, July 29 U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Wednesday that the Chinese government's reaction to its falling stock market will signal how dedicated the country is to its reform agenda.\n\"They need to move from a heavily centralized industrial model to a more consumer-oriented, competitive market model. That's going to mean change, and that kind of change is going to be disruptive,\" he told reporters.\n\"I think the serious question that comes out of the market is, what does it mean in terms of China's resolve to continue with the reform program?\"\nLew said the Chinese government will have to balance economic theory with the pace of change they can implement.\n\"I hope for the sake of China's economy and the world economy that they stick to the reform agenda,\" he said.

The bank said it was taking a more neutral view based on Senegal exposure. \nIn a world of lower commodity prices and capex cuts, investors should reassess whether to attach tangible value to pre-development assets within E&P portfolios, the bank said. \nIt added that this is especially true at a time when both industry and investor enthusiasm for exploration opportunities are at their lowest ebb in the E&P cycle. \n\"For Cairn, this meant revisiting our previous negative view on its prospective acreage in Senegal ahead of this year's appraisal drilling programme,\" said SocGen. \nIt said the market remains wary of de-risking a commercial find on the Senegal discovery well too early following Tullow's Zaedyus discovery well in 2011, which was later deemed to be sub-commercial. \n\"As such, we expect investors to maintain a healthy degree of scepticism ahead of a two well appraisal drilling programmes commencing in the fourth-quarter on the SNE-1 shelf discovery in Senegal.\" SocGen said the main upside to the Cairn Energy story remains the resolution of its Indian tax issue, but the bank noted that it has long taken a more cautious approach than the consensus on the timeline for any resolution. \n\"In our view, the share price trades at a small premium above core NAV that is equal to 15% probability of a commercial discovery in Senegal,\" it said. \nIt added that the next catalyst will be the interim results on 18 August. \nAt 10:10, Cairn Energy shares were up 2.8% at 168.58p.",

Learn more... \nFri, Jul 24, 2015, 11:35 BST - UK Markets close in 4 hrs 55 mins Cairn Energy boosted by SocGen upgrade to 'hold' By Michele Maatouk | Sharecast – 17 minutes ago 165.40 +1.4000 \nLONDON (ShareCast) - (ShareCast News) - Cairn Energy (LSE: CNE.L - news ) got a boost on Friday after Societe Generale (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) upgraded the stock to 'hold' from 'sell' and raised the price target to 180p from 165p, saying the risk/reward has improved. The bank said it was taking a more neutral view based on Senegal exposure. \nIn a world of lower commodity prices and capex cuts, investors should reassess whether to attach tangible value to pre-development assets within E&P portfolios, the bank said. \nIt added that this is especially true at a time when both industry and investor enthusiasm for exploration opportunities are at their lowest ebb in the E&P cycle. \n\"For Cairn, this meant revisiting our previous negative view on its prospective acreage in Senegal ahead of this year's appraisal drilling programme,\" said SocGen. \nIt said the market remains wary of de-risking a commercial find on the Senegal discovery well too early following Tullow's Zaedyus discovery well in 2011, which was later deemed to be sub-commercial. \n\"As such, we expect investors to maintain a healthy degree of scepticism ahead of a two well appraisal drilling programmes commencing in the fourth-quarter on the SNE-1 shelf discovery in Senegal.\" SocGen said the main upside to the Cairn Energy story remains the resolution of its Indian tax issue, but the bank noted that it has long taken a more cautious approach than the consensus on the timeline for any resolution. \n\"In our view, the share price trades at a small premium above core NAV that is equal to 15% probability of a commercial discovery in Senegal,\" it said. \nIt added that the next catalyst will be the interim results on 18 August. \nAt 10:10, Cairn Energy shares were up 2.8% at 168.58p.",

While African nations including Uganda tightened monetary policy this year, most developing countries cut borrowing costs or held rates to support their economies amid a global commodities rout.\nThat may change as accelerating consumer prices spur negative real rates in about half of the developing economies the JPMorgan covers, the bank said in a report. South Africa’s inflation rate threatens to exceed the 6 percent target, while in Brazil the level now stands at more than 9 percent. Developing-nation consumer prices reached a low of 4.6 percent in May and will soon quicken, in part because oil won’t fall as far as it did last year, according to Capital Economics.\n“The South African Reserve Bank move foreshadows a broader shift toward emerging-market tightening late this year and in 2016 that is not priced into financial markets,” David Hensley, the New York-based director for global economics at JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed response to questions on Friday. “Inflation is set to rise across the emerging-market complex against a backdrop of very low policy rates.”\nCapital Flight Many developing economies depend on stock and bond investments to finance current-account deficits, making them vulnerable capital outflows in the the event of a Fed rate increase. Economists project a 50 percent chance of a rates liftoff at its September meeting, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.\n“The emerging-market economies broadly have become dependent on portfolio inflows to finance activity, regardless of their current-account position,” Hensley said. “When the Fed starts raising rates, these vulnerabilities will show through, pressuring currency rates and creating problems with inflation, currency mismatches on dollar debt and higher debt servicing costs.”\nFour out of 31 emerging-market nations monitored by Bloomberg cut interest rates this year, while 14 increased borrowing costs.",
