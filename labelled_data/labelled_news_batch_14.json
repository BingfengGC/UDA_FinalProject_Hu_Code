The June readings had shown some signs that it was stabilising. \nEconomists say persistent weakness in China's imports point to a weak domestic economy.

The June readings had shown some signs that it was stabilising. \nEconomists say persistent weakness in China's imports point to a weak domestic economy. Meanwhile, erratic global demand and a relatively strong yuan have weighed on exports. \n(Reporting by Gerry Shih and Winni Zhou; Editing by Mark Bendeich)",

Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) operated MLNG Dua via a production sharing contract signed with Petronas since 1993. \nMalaysia is the world's second-largest exporter of LNG, according to the U.S Energy Information Administration.

Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) operated MLNG Dua via a production sharing contract signed with Petronas since 1993. \nMalaysia is the world's second-largest exporter of LNG, according to the U.S Energy Information Administration. LNG revenues made up some 2.7 percent of the Southeast Asia nation's gross domestic product, according to World Bank data. (Reporting By Yantoultra Ngui, editing by William Hardy)",

It is estimated that the number of new cases of AF is expected to rise from 120,000 in 2014 to 215,000 by 2030. \n“With the increasing number of individuals with atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias, the adoption of catheter ablation procedures will increase as these procedures reduce surgical time and cost, and improve patient outcomes,” says Faisal Ghaus, Vice President of Technavio. \nThe latest report by Technavio also emphasizes the use of robotic-assisted navigation technologies, which have significantly improved the navigation of catheter needles, electrodes, and tips to the target during ablation procedures. \n“The new technology used in cardiac catheters enhance visualization of the catheter's orientation, thereby improving procedural efficiency,” adds Ghaus. \nMarket Scope and Calculation of Market Size \nThe new Technavio report covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the ablation catheters market in Europe from 2015-2019. To calculate the market size, we consider revenue generated from sales based on different types of catheters, including single-point ablation catheters and multi-electrode ablation catheters, and different procedures, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia. \nKey Information Covered in the Report: Key Vendors:",

Learn more... \nWed, Aug 19, 2015, 09:54 BST - UK Markets close in 6 hrs 36 mins Profits fall at FTSE newcomer Hikma after decline in generics business By Sophie Jamieson | Telegraph – 7 minutes ago 21.75 -0.61 \nA decline in revenue from generics hit profits at Hikma, which joined the FTSE 100 this year \nPharmaceuticals company Hikma has hailed an “excellent start to the year” despite a decline in revenue in its generics business. \nThe division that produces unbranded, generic drugs saw its revenue fall from $128m to $79m in the first half of the year. Hikma attributed the decline to greater competition and a tough comparison with the first half of 2014, when it reported an \"exceptionally strong performance\". \nHikma said the “expected\" decline in generics offset good performances in its branded and injectables businesses, which helped generate group revenue of $709m in the six months to June 30. This was unchanged from the year before at constant currency rates, but down 4pc at actual rates. \nHikma's pre-tax profits were down 22pc to $170m. \nJordan-based Hikma, which also makes branded drugs, recently acquired speciality generics business Roxane from German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim. Hikma expects the $2.65bn deal to transform its position in the US, making it the states' sixth largest generics company by revenue. \nGenerics are out-of-patent drugs, usually as effective but much cheaper than brand-name drugs. \nHikma entered the FTSE 100 in March, joining other pharmaceuticals groups AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) , GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) and Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) in the top flight. \nDespite the profit fall, Hikma expects full-year revenue to grow by 2pc, or 6pc in constant currency rates. \nSaid Darwazah , chief executive, said: \"We have had an excellent start to the year. Our financial results are in line with expectations and we are making strong strategic progress across the group.”",

Learn more... \nWed, Aug 19, 2015, 09:54 BST - UK Markets close in 6 hrs 36 mins Profits fall at FTSE newcomer Hikma after decline in generics business By Sophie Jamieson | Telegraph – 7 minutes ago 21.75 -0.61 \nA decline in revenue from generics hit profits at Hikma, which joined the FTSE 100 this year \nPharmaceuticals company Hikma has hailed an “excellent start to the year” despite a decline in revenue in its generics business. \nThe division that produces unbranded, generic drugs saw its revenue fall from $128m to $79m in the first half of the year. Hikma attributed the decline to greater competition and a tough comparison with the first half of 2014, when it reported an \"exceptionally strong performance\". \nHikma said the “expected\" decline in generics offset good performances in its branded and injectables businesses, which helped generate group revenue of $709m in the six months to June 30. This was unchanged from the year before at constant currency rates, but down 4pc at actual rates. \nHikma's pre-tax profits were down 22pc to $170m. \nJordan-based Hikma, which also makes branded drugs, recently acquired speciality generics business Roxane from German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim. Hikma expects the $2.65bn deal to transform its position in the US, making it the states' sixth largest generics company by revenue. \nGenerics are out-of-patent drugs, usually as effective but much cheaper than brand-name drugs. \nHikma entered the FTSE 100 in March, joining other pharmaceuticals groups AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) , GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) and Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) in the top flight. \nDespite the profit fall, Hikma expects full-year revenue to grow by 2pc, or 6pc in constant currency rates. \nSaid Darwazah , chief executive, said: \"We have had an excellent start to the year. Our financial results are in line with expectations and we are making strong strategic progress across the group.”",

He still has a week to keep Santa on the job. \n\"We will take care of it. We have already collected half of the sum,\" Kariniemi told AFP. \nEvery year around 300,000 tourists of 100 different nationalities visit Santa's Office -- which claims to be the official one -- in Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle in Finnish Lapland. \nSanta's Office is part of an amusement park called Santa Claus Village hosting several companies. The Village and the other companies are not affected by the court's proceedings. \nThe head of the Rovaniemi Regional Development Agency, Juha Seppala, said his organisation would make sure Santa is there in the future. \n\"There is no way the Village (Taiwan OTC: 2735.TWO - news ) would be left without Santa Claus. The activities will continue in one way or another,\" he told AFP. \nKariniemi said his company's financial difficulties were due to \"the turbulence in the world\" resulting in a drop in the number of tourists visiting the region. \n\"First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) there were fewer tourists coming from Greece, then from Spain, Italy and Portugal, and eventually from Russia,\" he explained, referring to the economic downturn in those countries. \nIn January Finnish Border Guards reported a 33-percent drop from December 2013 to December 2014 in border crossings between Finland and its eastern neighbour Russia, which sends the most tourists to Finland, and has been affected by the fall of the ruble.",

Learn more... \nThu, Aug 20, 2015, 17:50 BST - UK Markets closed Santa Claus files for bankruptcy in Finland AFP – 14 minutes ago View Photo \n\nSanta Claus is broke and has filed for bankruptcy in Finland, or at least a popular tourist attraction on the Arctic Circle has done so. \nAccording to court documents on Thursday, Dianordia, a company which fulfils the dream of children and their families from all over the world to meet Santa Claus in person, needs a bit of Christmas cheer. \nTax authorities have filed a bankruptcy case in court as Dianordia owes over 200,000 euros ( $230,000) in taxes. \nBut the head of the company Jarmo Kariniemi says he is not ready to give up. He still has a week to keep Santa on the job. \n\"We will take care of it. We have already collected half of the sum,\" Kariniemi told AFP. \nEvery year around 300,000 tourists of 100 different nationalities visit Santa's Office -- which claims to be the official one -- in Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle in Finnish Lapland. \nSanta's Office is part of an amusement park called Santa Claus Village hosting several companies. The Village and the other companies are not affected by the court's proceedings. \nThe head of the Rovaniemi Regional Development Agency, Juha Seppala, said his organisation would make sure Santa is there in the future. \n\"There is no way the Village (Taiwan OTC: 2735.TWO - news ) would be left without Santa Claus. The activities will continue in one way or another,\" he told AFP. \nKariniemi said his company's financial difficulties were due to \"the turbulence in the world\" resulting in a drop in the number of tourists visiting the region. \n\"First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) there were fewer tourists coming from Greece, then from Spain, Italy and Portugal, and eventually from Russia,\" he explained, referring to the economic downturn in those countries. \nIn January Finnish Border Guards reported a 33-percent drop from December 2013 to December 2014 in border crossings between Finland and its eastern neighbour Russia, which sends the most tourists to Finland, and has been affected by the fall of the ruble.",

The surplus stood at 1.0 billion euros versus 1.25 billion euros in June 2014. Tourism revenues rose to 1.91 billion euros from 1.89 billion euros in the same month last year. Last year Greece posted a current account surplus of 1.66 billion euros, up from 1.09 billion euros in 2013, helped by higher tourism revenues - its biggest foreign currency earner.

Banks led the drop, with Piraeus Bank SA slumping 30 percent, while National Bank of Greece SA tumbled 29 percent.\nThe benchmark gauge slid 16 percent yesterday, when trading on the Athens Stock Exchange resumed.\nTrading is hampered because of emergency curbs put in place as the nation still has capital controls in place.\nA total of 58 stocks were halted or paused yesterday, the Athens exchange said. Stocks with extreme volatility were halted sooner than normal, while would-be buyers had to raise money from places other than their bank accounts. Less than 31 million ASE shares changed hands on Monday, the least since November.\nGreek stocks have lost 85 percent of their value since 2007. The nation’s benchmark gauge closed at its lowest level since September 2012 on Monday.",

Allison Koury, his lawyer, said she was \"very pleased\" with the sentence.\nProsecutors said McPhail learned secret information about American Superconductor from an unnamed senior executive who, like him, belonged to the Oakley Country Club in Watertown, Massachusetts.\nDespite hearing the information in confidence, McPhail starting in 2009 began sharing with his friends the inside information about the company's business activities and earnings announcements, prosecutors said.\nOver a two-year period, McPhail's friends made over $500,000 by illegally trading on the tips, prosecutors said. Parigian alone made more than $267,000, prosecutors have said.\nThe trial and Parigian's plea came after Casper rejected a bid to dismiss the case in light of a December ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that curtailed authorities' ability to pursue insider trading.\nWhile the decision, which reversed the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, only applied to judges in New York, Vermont and Connecticut, defendants in other states have sought to take advantage of it in their cases.\nParigian's plea deal allows him to appeal Casper's decision. The U.S. Justice Department has meanwhile petitioned the Supreme Court to review the 2nd Circuit's ruling.\nThe case is U.S. v. McPhail, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 14-cr-10201. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by G Crosse and James Dalgleish)",

        "text": "RIMINI, Italy Aug 22 China's economic slowdown and a sharp fall in its stock market herald not a crisis but a \"necessary\" adjustment for the world's second biggest economy, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Saturday.\nFresh evidence of easing growth in China hammered global stock markets on Friday, driving Wall Street to its steepest one-day drop in nearly four years.\n\"Monetary policies have been very expansive in recent years and an adjustment is necessary,\" said Carlo Cottarelli, an IMF executive director representing countries such as Italy and Greece on its board.\n\"It's totally premature to speak of a crisis in China,\" he told a press conference.\nHe reiterated an IMF forecast for a 6.8 percent expansion in the Chinese economy this year, below the 7.4 percent growth achieved in 2014.\n\"China's real economy is slowing but it's perfectly natural that this should happen ...

Its institutional partners are putting up the rest. \nAccording to a statement, each Asciano shareholder will receive Aus$6.94 in cash and 0.0387 Brookfield units, for a total value of Aus$9.15 per share. \nThis represents a 39 percent premium over Asciano's share price on July 1, the day it disclosed talks with Brookfield. \nThe deal, which has the unanimous support of Asciano's board, comes amid a flurry of takeovers in Australia's transport sector amid a decline in the country's currency. \nJapan Post Holdings recently purchased logistics firm Toll Holdings after a consortium led by China Merchants Group acquired Newcastle Port last year.",

Its institutional partners are putting up the rest. \nAccording to a statement, each Asciano shareholder will receive Aus$6.94 in cash and 0.0387 Brookfield units, for a total value of Aus$9.15 per share. \nThis represents a 39 percent premium over Asciano's share price on July 1, the day it disclosed talks with Brookfield. \nThe deal, which has the unanimous support of Asciano's board, comes amid a flurry of takeovers in Australia's transport sector amid a decline in the country's currency. \nJapan Post Holdings recently purchased logistics firm Toll Holdings after a consortium led by China Merchants Group acquired Newcastle Port last year.",

Russia's Progress freighter, one of which failed to reach the station in April, resumed flights last month.\n\"We're in good shape right now, but if for some reason HTV didn't get here, we get pretty low on certain consumables probably in late September, early October,\" NASA astronaut Scott Kelly said during an inflight interview on Monday.\nIn addition to refilling the station's pantries, HTV carries spacesuit gear, water filters, a galley and science instruments, including a telescope to measure cosmic rays, particles with the highest energy in the universe.\nScientists are interested in the composition of the rays and why they have such high energy levels.\n\"Cosmic rays come at you from all directions and all the time,\" John Wefel, a Louisiana State University astrophysicist, said in a NASA TV interview. \"Every time one of these high-energy cosmic rays comes at us and starts triggering the instrument, we record it.\"\nThe telescope, which will be mounted outside the station, is expected to operate up to five years.

Russia's Progress freighter, one of which failed to reach the station in April, resumed flights last month.\n\"We're in good shape right now, but if for some reason HTV didn't get here, we get pretty low on certain consumables probably in late September, early October,\" NASA astronaut Scott Kelly said during an inflight interview on Monday.\nIn addition to refilling the station's pantries, HTV carries spacesuit gear, water filters, a galley and science instruments, including a telescope to measure cosmic rays, particles with the highest energy in the universe.\nScientists are interested in the composition of the rays and why they have such high energy levels.\n\"Cosmic rays come at you from all directions and all the time,\" John Wefel, a Louisiana State University astrophysicist, said in a NASA TV interview. \"Every time one of these high-energy cosmic rays comes at us and starts triggering the instrument, we record it.\"\nThe telescope, which will be mounted outside the station, is expected to operate up to five years.

When asked if the China shake-up was made in preparation for such a move, Blum said, \"No.\"\nSu will serve as an executive adviser through February 2016 to assist with the management transition. Su will remain on Yum's board of directors, Yum said.\nThe company also announced that Joey Wat, 44, was promoted to CEO of KFC China. She was previously president of KFC China. Peter Kao, 58, was promoted CEO of the Pizza Hut brand in China. Kao was previously senior vice president and brand general manager of Pizza Hut China.\nJ.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe said in a client note in May that he came away from Yum's recent China investor conference with sense that a spin off of the China business was more a \"probability\" than a \"possibility.\"\nHedge fund Corvex Management, which has been urging Yum to spin off its China operations, has said the business could be worth more than Yum's share price suggests.\nCorvex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nYum's China business has been fighting to recover from a meat quality scare at one of its minor suppliers.\nBlum, the spokesman, said sales at established restaurants in China have turned significantly positive in the current quarter.

When asked if the China shake-up was made in preparation for such a move, Blum said, \"No.\"\nSu will serve as an executive adviser through February 2016 to assist with the management transition. Su will remain on Yum's board of directors, Yum said.\nThe company also announced that Joey Wat, 44, was promoted to CEO of KFC China. She was previously president of KFC China. Peter Kao, 58, was promoted CEO of the Pizza Hut brand in China. Kao was previously senior vice president and brand general manager of Pizza Hut China.\nJ.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe said in a client note in May that he came away from Yum's recent China investor conference with sense that a spin off of the China business was more a \"probability\" than a \"possibility.\"\nHedge fund Corvex Management, which has been urging Yum to spin off its China operations, has said the business could be worth more than Yum's share price suggests.\nCorvex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nYum's China business has been fighting to recover from a meat quality scare at one of its minor suppliers.\nBlum, the spokesman, said sales at established restaurants in China have turned significantly positive in the current quarter.

Treasuries were steady on \nFriday and were poised to end the week stronger after minutes \nfrom the Federal Reserve's most recent policymaking meeting \ndidn't indicate that the Fed is likely to begin raising interest \nrates next month. \nA dovish interpretation of the U.S. central bank's July \nmeeting minutes, and concerns about low inflation as crude oil \nfalls to 6-1/2 year lows, have added a bid for U.S. debt this \nweek. \nInvestors will closely evaluate a speech by Fed Vice Chair \nStanley Fischer at Jackson Hole on Aug. 29 for clues on whether \na rate increase in September is likely. \nThe employment report for August, to be released next month, \nwill also be crucial, coming ahead of the Fed meeting in \nSeptember. \n\"The September rate hike is still possible, but you're not \ngoing to get a better feel on that until you see the employment \nreport,\" said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at \nBank of Nova Scotia (Other OTC: BKSHF - news ) in New York. \nBenchmark 10-year notes last yielded 2.08 \npercent, down from 2.20 percent last Friday. \nLarge index extensions heading into month-end and concerns \nabout tumbling stock markets may keep yields low. \n\"Month-end is a week from Monday and there's a large \nextension for Treasuries, so I think they will stay bid,\" \nComiskey said. \nThe Treasury will also sell $90 billion in new \ncoupon-bearing debt next week, including $26 billion in two-year \nnotes, $35 billion in five-year notes and $29 billion in \nseven-year notes.",

Treasuries were steady on \nFriday and were poised to end the week stronger after minutes \nfrom the Federal Reserve's most recent policymaking meeting \ndidn't indicate that the Fed is likely to begin raising interest \nrates next month. \nA dovish interpretation of the U.S. central bank's July \nmeeting minutes, and concerns about low inflation as crude oil \nfalls to 6-1/2 year lows, have added a bid for U.S. debt this \nweek. \nInvestors will closely evaluate a speech by Fed Vice Chair \nStanley Fischer at Jackson Hole on Aug. 29 for clues on whether \na rate increase in September is likely. \nThe employment report for August, to be released next month, \nwill also be crucial, coming ahead of the Fed meeting in \nSeptember. \n\"The September rate hike is still possible, but you're not \ngoing to get a better feel on that until you see the employment \nreport,\" said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at \nBank of Nova Scotia (Other OTC: BKSHF - news ) in New York. \nBenchmark 10-year notes last yielded 2.08 \npercent, down from 2.20 percent last Friday. \nLarge index extensions heading into month-end and concerns \nabout tumbling stock markets may keep yields low. \n\"Month-end is a week from Monday and there's a large \nextension for Treasuries, so I think they will stay bid,\" \nComiskey said. \nThe Treasury will also sell $90 billion in new \ncoupon-bearing debt next week, including $26 billion in two-year \nnotes, $35 billion in five-year notes and $29 billion in \nseven-year notes.",

This suggests that demand for energy may remain tepid,\" he told AFP. \nAsian shares fell on Friday, continuing a global sell-off in equities that hit Wall Street overnight and saw the Dow reach its lowest level this year as concerns about the health of the world economy snowballed. \nAnalysts fear a slowdown in China, the world's second-biggest economy, could drag on global growth and curb energy demand -- bad news for oil prices at a time when markets are already oversupplied with crude. \nOil has managed to hold above the key $40 a barrel mark, but US banking giant Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) said on Wednesday prices could fall to $32 a barrel, a multi-year low last seen in 2008. \nInvestors will be watching the weekly US oil rig count, due on Friday, to see if a slump in crude prices has started to dampen production in the world's top consumer. \n\"If we would to see any relief for crude prices, it has to come from production cuts,\" Aw said. \nThe United States and producers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have decided against cutting high production levels despite falling prices as they fight over market share.",

This suggests that demand for energy may remain tepid,\" he told AFP. \nAsian shares fell on Friday, continuing a global sell-off in equities that hit Wall Street overnight and saw the Dow reach its lowest level this year as concerns about the health of the world economy snowballed. \nAnalysts fear a slowdown in China, the world's second-biggest economy, could drag on global growth and curb energy demand -- bad news for oil prices at a time when markets are already oversupplied with crude. \nOil has managed to hold above the key $40 a barrel mark, but US banking giant Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) said on Wednesday prices could fall to $32 a barrel, a multi-year low last seen in 2008. \nInvestors will be watching the weekly US oil rig count, due on Friday, to see if a slump in crude prices has started to dampen production in the world's top consumer. \n\"If we would to see any relief for crude prices, it has to come from production cuts,\" Aw said. \nThe United States and producers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have decided against cutting high production levels despite falling prices as they fight over market share.",

That also lowered crude oil prices, widening refiners' potential profits. \nValero planned earlier this year to install the flue gas cooler on the 65,000-bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) beginning in mid-October, the sources said. \nThe earliest it can begin now is late October, and the refinery is also weighing putting it off until early December or early 2016 as part of a planned overhaul that will include the smaller of two crude distillation units (CDU) and other units at the refinery. \nValero spokesman Steven Lee declined to discuss the company's plans for the Memphis refinery. \nValero has previously rescheduled the flue gas cooler's installation due to high refining margins. Valero had laid plans to install the large device in late June only to reschedule to mid-October. \nThe flue gas cooler is part of the FCCU's system for reducing pollution from the unit. \nThe cooler, which will be attached by a crane high on the side of the FCCU, improves the efficiency of the unit while reducing the temperature of the circulating catalyst. The catalyst is key to the production of gasoline. \nThe work scheduled for early 2016 centers around the Memphis refinery's 80,000-bpd CDU and the production units it supplies, the sources said.

A working group had been slated to deliver a so-called debt adjustment plan on Sunday or Monday, but will hold off until as late as Sept. 8.\nUnlike U.S. states, Puerto Rico does not have access to U.S. bankruptcy laws. The religious leaders support changing that through a measure that has been introduced in the U.S. House and Senate. But, if Congress does not act, the leaders want the Federal Reserve to intervene and help restructure the island's debt, according to the statement.\n\"We have been looking at the powers the Federal Reserve has and the tool box the Federal Reserve has,\" said Eric LeCompte, the executive director of Jubilee.\nA report completed by a foundation on the island, cited by LeCompte, lays out how the Fed may be able to help Puerto Rico, including by buying Puerto Rico debt and offering financial planning assistance.\nThe New York Fed, which represents the island in the Federal Reserve System, has released two reports on the island's economy, which has been at or near recession for close to a decade. A call to a spokesperson at the New York Fed was not immediately returned.\n\"This debt crisis threatens to push more of our people into poverty and put people out of work,\" said San Juan Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez Nieves, leader of Puerto Rico's mostly Catholic population. \"The religious community stands with vulnerable people and we call for the crisis to be resolved in a way that protects the poor and grows our economy.\" (Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli, editing by Dave Gregorio)",

A working group had been slated to deliver a so-called debt adjustment plan on Sunday or Monday, but will hold off until as late as Sept. 8.\nUnlike U.S. states, Puerto Rico does not have access to U.S. bankruptcy laws. The religious leaders support changing that through a measure that has been introduced in the U.S. House and Senate. But, if Congress does not act, the leaders want the Federal Reserve to intervene and help restructure the island's debt, according to the statement.\n\"We have been looking at the powers the Federal Reserve has and the tool box the Federal Reserve has,\" said Eric LeCompte, the executive director of Jubilee.\nA report completed by a foundation on the island, cited by LeCompte, lays out how the Fed may be able to help Puerto Rico, including by buying Puerto Rico debt and offering financial planning assistance.\nThe New York Fed, which represents the island in the Federal Reserve System, has released two reports on the island's economy, which has been at or near recession for close to a decade. A call to a spokesperson at the New York Fed was not immediately returned.\n\"This debt crisis threatens to push more of our people into poverty and put people out of work,\" said San Juan Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez Nieves, leader of Puerto Rico's mostly Catholic population. \"The religious community stands with vulnerable people and we call for the crisis to be resolved in a way that protects the poor and grows our economy.\" (Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli, editing by Dave Gregorio)",

Filipinos, particularly those working in business process outsourcing firms and families of overseas workers, are increasingly buying insurance policies thanks to more disposable income.

        "text": "WASHINGTON Aug 4 Oklahoma regulators are imposing new restrictions on energy companies injecting wastewater underground, in the latest effort to stem a sharp increase in earthquakes.\nThe new rules, announced by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission on Monday evening, require operators in parts of two Oklahoma counties to reduce the amount of saltwater they inject underground by 38 percent from current levels in the next 60 days. The reduction will bring injected volumes to about 2.4 million barrels below those in 2012, when the most dramatic spike in the area earthquakes began.\nThe restrictions affect 23 wells run by 12 operators.

        "text_full": "Oklahoma regulators impose water injection cut to stem earthquakes\nWASHINGTON Aug 4 Oklahoma regulators are imposing new restrictions on energy companies injecting wastewater underground, in the latest effort to stem a sharp increase in earthquakes.\nThe new rules, announced by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission on Monday evening, require operators in parts of two Oklahoma counties to reduce the amount of saltwater they inject underground by 38 percent from current levels in the next 60 days. The reduction will bring injected volumes to about 2.4 million barrels below those in 2012, when the most dramatic spike in the area earthquakes began.\nThe restrictions affect 23 wells run by 12 operators. The operators are mostly small companies, but one of the wells is run by Devon Energy Corp of Oklahoma City.

        "text_full": "US SF WRAP-Longer loans add to auto ABS worries\n+1.50 \nBy Joy Wiltermuth \nNEW YORK, Aug 27 (IFR) - Borrowers are taking out longer loans to buy cars, a new report said on Thursday, adding to worries about the quality of the collateral underpinning auto ABS securitizations. \nMore than 16% of used cars purchased in the second quarter were with loans of six and seven years, Experian Automotive said - an all-time high up from under 15% in the same period of 2014. \nFor new cars the figure was almost 29%, a whopping increase from just under 20% a year ago. \n\"Anything over five years has a higher chance of losses,\" Fitch Ratings analyst Hylton Heard told IFR. \"This is something we are watching.\" \nThe report comes near the end of a summer that has seen push-back from investors on new auto loan ABS issues. \nWhen used car seller CarMax (NYSE: KMX - news ) came to market in early August with a US$1bn prime loan trade, its senior slices priced nearly on top of a US$1bn auto bond backed by much riskier subprime collateral. \nIts loans had an average remaining term of 64.31 months, levels that a Fitch pre-sale report noted indicated slightly weaker credit quality versus comparable bonds. \nFitch says that none of the auto bonds it has rated over the past 10 years have suffered a loss due to weakness in collateral quality. \nBut some on the buyside feel they are not being sufficiently compensated for the increased default risks. \nTracy Chen, a global investment manager at Brandywine Global, said she is avoiding new prime and subprime ABS issues, in part because bond spreads are not wide enough for the weaker structures she is seeing. \nBut Chen told IFR she also has longer-term worries about the auto sector, and said she has been buying credit protection on General Motors (NYSE: GM - news ) . \nIn particular, she is concerned that a slowdown in China will impact growth in other countries - and consumer demand in general. \n\"We are not very bullish on the auto industry,\" Chen said. \"China slowing has a huge impact on the industry.\" (Reporting by Joy Wiltermuth; Editing by Natalie Harrison and Marc Carnegie)",

Spot prices hit a peak of $1,168.40 on Friday. \n\"After the devaluation of the Chinese currency, people are worried,\" said Rajan Venkatesh, head of India bullion at ScotiaMocatta, part of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO). \"They are afraid of a currency war. They are going back to gold.\" \nPrices could rise to $1,230 to $1,240 within a month, he said on the sidelines of the International Gold Convention in the city of Panaji in western Goa state. \nMichael Mesaric, chief executive of the world's biggest gold refiner, Valcambi, said deposits in gold-backed exchange-traded funds are hovering near their lowest levels since 2008 but current prices will attract new buying. \nHe expects gold prices to rise to $1,350 by mid 2016. \nThe recent bounce notwithstanding, gold has been under heavy pressure this year from expectations the Fed would raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade, lifting the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar. \nBut analysts like Jeffrey Rhodes, founder of Dubai-based precious metals consultancy RPMC, said: \"All the bad news for gold is in the press\". \n\"There is room in the world for strong dollar and strong gold,\" said Rhodes, expecting higher demand in countries such as India, China and Greece, where currencies are depreciating. \"And strong gold is an alternative to emerging market currency.\" \n(Editing by Dominic Evans)",
