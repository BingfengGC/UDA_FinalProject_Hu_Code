        "text": "Australia’s stock market was once synonymous with raw materials. Not anymore.\nCommodity producers and the companies that service them made up less than 14 percent of the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index on Tuesday, the smallest share in data going back to 2002. In 2008, material shares comprised almost one third of the gauge. BHP Billiton Ltd.’s market value is now about A$7 billion ($4.9 billion) less than that of Commonwealth Bank of Australia. At its peak seven years ago, the mining company was more than A$200 billion bigger.\nMining companies sank in Sydney on Tuesday as Glencore Plc’s stock-price collapse highlighted the threat of sliding commodity prices amid China’s economic slowdown. Investors are questioning global growth forecasts as the Federal Reserve prepares to lift U.S. interest rates, which will push up the dollar and further weigh on commodities, according to money manager Angus Gluskie.\n“We are staying away at this stage,” said Gluskie, a managing director who oversees $550 million at White Funds Management Pty Ltd. in Sydney. “They are cyclical assets and in the peak period, the percentage of the market that they made up was inflated. Now we’re coming back to the other extreme and somewhere in the middle is probably the longer-term average.”\nThe world’s two biggest mining companies, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group, trade in Sydney. Still, financial firms make up the largest share of Australia’s stock market. That proportion has steadily risen since 2008 as the commodity component has decreased, and now stands at 47 percent. Financials make up 21 percent of the MSCI World Index and materials firms 4.4 percent.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 fell 2.9 percent as of 1:49 p.m. in Sydney. The measure has tumbled 17 percent since reaching a seven-year high in April, while the gauge of material stocks is down 21 percent from a March peak through Monday.\n“It’s not just China but people’s growth forecasts for the world are continuing to nudge down,” Gluskie said. “With the resource space it’s a bit of a realization that there are some ongoing factors that’ll work against it. People are adjusting to that in their thinking and maybe some investors had been a bit blasé in the lead up.”",

We want to grow our deep water and constrain our onshore oil production,\" Osagie Okunbor told reporters in Port Harcourt, the country's oil hub. \nShell has been divesting onshore oil-producing assets for the last few years and completed another set near the end of March. \nThe sales are part of an effort to move away from onshore oil projects in Nigeria, which are plagued by industrial scale theft, security problems and pipeline spills, which have become a growing legal liability. \nOkunbor added that Shell's flagship project would be the Gbaran-Ubie project, which will increase gas supplies for the Bonny liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal. A first phase began production in 2010. \nBonny is Nigeria's only LNG export terminal. (Reporting by Julia Payne; Editing by Pravin Char and Adrian Croft)",

The 7 percent decline in annual disbursements was fueled by reductions of 17 percent and 6 percent in lending to commerce and services borrowers and manufacturers, respectively.\nAbout 50 percent less loans were approved in the first half from a year ago, suggesting the Rio de Janeiro-based lender is implementing stricter criteria for credit allocation.\nThe sharp declines in all credit indicators suggest that companies are paring back or delaying investment plans as the economy contracts. For decades, Brazilian companies large and small have been hooked on cheap credit from BNDES, which is regarded as the nation's main source of long-term corporate credit.\nBNDES is gradually streamlining loans as part of efforts by President Dilma Rousseff's administration to mitigate the impact of a mounting budget deficit and the crowding-out of banks and debt markets from corporate financing. BNDES grew too large since Rousseff's first term started in 2011, and credit rating firms have urged her to downsize it as a condition to maintain the nation's investment-grade status.\nBNDES is among banks most at risk over loans to state-controlled oil producer Petróleo Brasileiro SA and third-party contractors in the oil services and engineering industries in the wake of an alleged corruption scheme unveiled at the company.\n($1 = 3.7548 Brazilian reais) (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Bernard Orr )",

Learn more... \nMon, Sep 28, 2015, 10:56 BST - UK Markets close in 5 hrs 34 mins 2.1m Audi Cars Have VW Emission Cheat Device By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 4 minutes 30 seconds ago View Photo \n\nAudi (LSE: 0FG8.L - news ) says 2.1m of its cars were fitted with emission cheating software, as Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) is said to have suspended the research and development heads of three divisions. \nThe luxury car brand, which is a subsidiary of Volkswagen, has admitted that millions of its vehicles with so-called EU5 engines have an emissions \"cheat device\" installed. \nVolkswagen itself was forced to apologise last week after it was discovered that it had developed the device in order to trick emission tests in the US. \nThe devices are able to detect when cars are undergoing tests, and can switch the vehicle to a low emission mode in order to achieve more favourable results. \nThis means that many people have bought cars which are much less environmentally friendly than they had been led to believe. \nAccording to the Audi spokesman, around 1.42 million Audi vehicles in Western Europe are fitted with the device, with 577,000 in Germany. \nAnother 13,000 Audi cars in the US are affected. \nVehicle lines involved include the Audi A1, A3, A4, A5, A6 and the TT, Q3 and Q5 models. \nVolkswagen said last week that around 11 million of its cars worldwide have been fitted with the cheat device. \nThen CEO of the Volkswagen Group, Martin Winterkorn, has been forced to resign over the revelations and was replaced by Matthias Müller, who has been the chief of another Volkswagen subsidiary, Porsche, since 2010.",

        "text": "Japan Tobacco Inc. is in talks to buy cigarette assets from Reynolds American Inc. as the company seeks to expand outside of its shrinking home market, according to people familiar with the talks.\nThe Japanese firm may acquire assets worth about $5 billion, including some of the Natural American Spirit tobacco brand that is part of a Reynolds operating company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. While discussions are advanced, talks could still fall apart and the size of the deal and the makeup of the assets could still change, they said.\nThe former Japanese tobacco monopoly has sped up acquisitions of brands and products abroad in the face of a shrinking population and a stagnating smoking rate at home. Japan Tobacco has said its priority is investing to boost the competitiveness of its tobacco businesses, which led to its withdrawal from drinks and vending machines.\nJapan Tobacco President Mitsuomi Koizumi said in February that 2015 would be the company’s “year of investments,” including increased stakes in other types of tobacco products such as e-cigarettes.\nReynolds, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is the second-largest U.S. tobacco company. It completed its acquisition of Lorillard Inc. in June for about $25 billion, adding the Newport cigarette brand and selling some of Lorillard’s other brands to Imperial Tobacco Group.\nReynolds’ Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, which owns Natural American Spirit, reported $658 million of revenue in fiscal year 2014, compared with $572 million in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The brand is facing pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Association, which sent a letter to Reynolds on Aug. 27 stating that the company needs to prove cigarettes they’ve labeled as “natural” or “additive-free” are less harmful in order to keep marketing them that way.\nA representative for Japan Tobacco didn’t have an immediate comment, and a spokesman for Reynolds couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.",

While discussions are advanced, talks could still fall apart and the size of the deal and the makeup of the assets could still change, they said.\nThe former Japanese tobacco monopoly has sped up acquisitions of brands and products abroad in the face of a shrinking population and a stagnating smoking rate at home. Japan Tobacco has said its priority is investing to boost the competitiveness of its tobacco businesses, which led to its withdrawal from drinks and vending machines.\nJapan Tobacco President Mitsuomi Koizumi said in February that 2015 would be the company’s “year of investments,” including increased stakes in other types of tobacco products such as e-cigarettes.\nReynolds, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is the second-largest U.S. tobacco company. It completed its acquisition of Lorillard Inc. in June for about $25 billion, adding the Newport cigarette brand and selling some of Lorillard’s other brands to Imperial Tobacco Group.\nReynolds’ Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, which owns Natural American Spirit, reported $658 million of revenue in fiscal year 2014, compared with $572 million in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The brand is facing pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Association, which sent a letter to Reynolds on Aug. 27 stating that the company needs to prove cigarettes they’ve labeled as “natural” or “additive-free” are less harmful in order to keep marketing them that way.\nA representative for Japan Tobacco didn’t have an immediate comment, and a spokesman for Reynolds couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.",

MBNA has offered £100 for goodwill, which you don’t think is enough. \nMBNA says that, when you were abroad, it wasn’t its policy to call customers to alert them that sums were still hitting their card in this way. Over recent months it has changed its approach and now calls customers to notify them. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here",

The banking sector, up just as much, was one of the main supports.\nNational Commercial Bank, the kingdom's largest lender, jumped 2.0 percent and Al Rajhi, another large bank, was up 0.7 percent.\nGrowth in Saudi Arabia's non-oil private sector rose to a five-month high in August, buoyed by the impact of increasing oil production, a survey of businesses showed on Thursday.\nEgypt's main stock index climbed 1.2 percent after the country's own purchasing managers' survey showed activity grew in August at the fastest pace of 2015 on the back of solid growth in output.\n\"This ... could be the first sign that the (Egyptian) economy has turned the corner after a weak first half of 2015,\" Jason Tuvey, the Middle East economist at Capital Economics in London, said in a note.\n\"This, coupled with July's sharp drop in the headline rate of inflation, supports our view that the central bank will cut interest rates, possibly as soon as its next meeting later this month.\" (Reporting by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Andrew Torchia and Catherine Evans)",

The banking sector, up just as much, was one of the main supports.\nNational Commercial Bank, the kingdom's largest lender, jumped 2.0 percent and Al Rajhi, another large bank, was up 0.7 percent.\nGrowth in Saudi Arabia's non-oil private sector rose to a five-month high in August, buoyed by the impact of increasing oil production, a survey of businesses showed on Thursday.\nEgypt's main stock index climbed 1.2 percent after the country's own purchasing managers' survey showed activity grew in August at the fastest pace of 2015 on the back of solid growth in output.\n\"This ... could be the first sign that the (Egyptian) economy has turned the corner after a weak first half of 2015,\" Jason Tuvey, the Middle East economist at Capital Economics in London, said in a note.\n\"This, coupled with July's sharp drop in the headline rate of inflation, supports our view that the central bank will cut interest rates, possibly as soon as its next meeting later this month.\" (Reporting by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Andrew Torchia and Catherine Evans)",

With one of the largest branch networks and the most retail customers, Lloyds has been able to reduce the interest it offers to depositors and offer loans on attractive terms. Conclusion \nIt's interesting to see that Virgin Money, a mid-sized challenger bank, is not doing as well as Lloyds Banking Group. Unlike the other 'big four' banks, Lloyds has refrained from international expansion and this has enabled it to gain more of the cost savings from local economies of scale.

As OneSavings Bank grows, its cost efficiency could benefit further from economies of scale and its return on equity would likely improve with increasing leverage. \nThere are near-term headwinds affecting OneSavings though. The proposed introduction of an 8% Bank Corporation Tax Surcharge would eat into the earnings of smaller banks, reducing the amount of capital available to support further growth.

Banks fired dozens of staff in the wake of an investigation by U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . and British authorities into alleged market manipulation, when seven banks were fined a combined $10 billion. \nRBS declined to comment. \nThe hearing of former Citigroup FX trader Perry Stimpson began at a London employment tribunal last week and is due to end on Thursday. Stimpson claims he was unfairly dismissed, saying the sharing of client information was widespread and condoned by senior management at the time. \nRBS, which is 73 percent owned by the British government, has paid $1.3 billion to U.S. and British authorities for failing to stop its traders rigging currency markets. \nAt the time of that settlement in May, RBS said it had dismissed three employees and suspended another two in relation to the FX scandal, and was continuing to review the conduct of current and former employees in its FX business.

Some other business-to-business transactions will be taxed at 10.5 percent.\nLuis Falcon, the president of CAT, told Reuters that while the taxes will affect all businesses, truckers are already stretched thin because of gas costs, fines and other business expenses. Falcon claimed the average driver nets only about $11,000 a year; Reuters could not verify that figure.\nMore than 100 trucks, mostly 18-wheelers, idled on Avenida Luis Munoz Rivera, a main road leading past the capitol and into the tourist district Old San Juan, site of the governor's mansion.\nIt is the latest act of resistance toward a reform plan by Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, proposed this month, to bring the poverty-stricken island out of $72 billion in debt.\nIn addition to the new taxes, the plan proposes spending reforms and benefit reductions to employees in both the public and private sectors, and demands concessions from financial creditors. The taxes have already been legislated, while the other proposals need legislation or U.S. federal government action, making them politically uncertain.\nGarcia Padilla has preached cooperation and the need for all sides to share the burden. Instead, his reform plan has faced universal attack, with each faction demanding more concessions from the others and many criticizing the government for failing to propose headcount reductions within its own ranks.\nEarlier this month, teachers and public workers rallied against benefit reductions outside the governor's mansion, while bondholder groups have threatened litigation if the government tries to reduce their repayments.\nGarcia Padilla, expected to face a strong challenge in next year's gubernatorial election, may need a consensual restructuring to salvage his political future. The Puerto Rican people, meanwhile, need one to boost their island's economy, where only about 40 percent of the population is in the workforce. (Editing by Leslie Adler)",

Abe will reveal the plan at a news conference on Thursday marking his election to a second three-year term, NHK said. \nThe GDP target could draw criticism for being unrealistic because it implies levels of growth not seen in the last two decades, and economists doubt the government will enact policies bold enough to even come close to the target. \n\"We can expect some measures to stimulate consumer spending because capital expenditure has not been strong enough,\" said Daiju Aoki, economist at UBS Securities. \n\"With out more radical reforms, this GDP target is unrealistic. Even at 3 percent annual growth, this would take seven years.\" \nIn fiscal 2014, nominal GDP was 491 trillion yen, so the economy would have to expand by 22 percent to reach the 600 trillion yen mark. Since fiscal 1994, the earliest date that data is available, Japan's nominal GDP has actually contracted by 1 percent. \nSince Abe took office in late 2012, nominal GDP has expanded 5.8 percent as the central bank pursued quantitative easing, and a stock market rally encouraged some individual investors to increase consumer spending. \nAfter an initial wave of success, investors have grown disappointed with the scale of Abe's structural economic reforms. \nCabinet ministers have recently said that Abe will also target increases in capital expenditure as he tries to breathe new life into his economic agenda. \nAbe is also trying to shift focus to the economy after the passage last week of controversial national security bills triggered massive protests and damaged his popularity. \nSupport for Abe's cabinet dropped six percentage points from last month to 40 percent, with its disapproval rate climbing seven points to 47 percent, according to an opinion poll by the Nikkei business daily. \nThe security bills would allow Japanese troops to fight overseas for the first time since the end of World War II, but many voters say this violates Japan's pacifist constitution. \n(Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Eric Meijer)",

The refinery is in central Ukraine, safe from the conflict in the east.\nUkrtatnafta plans to import CPC Blend from the Caspian pipeline consortium (CPC). It aims to buy some 160,000 tonnes a month of CPC Blend from the consortium, which pumps oil from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea.\nKremenchug, with nameplate capacity of 18.6 million tonnes a year (370,000 barrels per day), is running at only 14 percent of that. Transport bottlenecks and storage capacity restraints also hamper its plans to raise fuel output.\nThe major shareholders of CPC are Russia with 21 percent, Kazakhstan with 20.75 percent and Chevron with 15 percent.\n\"Ukrtatnafta plans to buy two tankers of the CPC blend a month from fields in Kazakhstan,\" the company said in emailed comments to Reuters.\nUkrtatnafta, according to its own estimates, accounts for 10 percent of Ukraine's oil products market, the rest being imported. It said it may increase that share to up to 30 percent by raising production. (Reporting by Alla Afanasyeva; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin, editing by William Hardy)",

Transport bottlenecks and storage capacity restraints also hamper its plans to raise fuel output.\nThe major shareholders of CPC are Russia with 21 percent, Kazakhstan with 20.75 percent and Chevron with 15 percent.\n\"Ukrtatnafta plans to buy two tankers of the CPC blend a month from fields in Kazakhstan,\" the company said in emailed comments to Reuters.\nUkrtatnafta, according to its own estimates, accounts for 10 percent of Ukraine's oil products market, the rest being imported. It said it may increase that share to up to 30 percent by raising production. (Reporting by Alla Afanasyeva; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin, editing by William Hardy)",

And talks with management have resumed in recent months. \nCockpit said Monday that it has made substantial concessions and accused management of seeking to \"smash wage-agreement structures and demolish protective mechanisms in order to weaken the union.\" \nLufthansa, which also owns Swiss and Austrian Airlines, has embarked on a massive reorganisation, farming out much of its domestic and medium-haul services to its low-cost airline division, Germanwings.",

        "text_full": "Lufthansa pilots call two-day strike\nView Photo \n\nPilots at German airline Lufthansa said Monday they will strike for two days this week, continuing a long-running dispute with management over early retirement provisions. \nAfter announcing walkouts on long-haul passenger services Tuesday, the pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit said on its internet site that short and medium-haul flights departing Germany \"between 0001 and 2359\" Wednesday (2201 GMT and 2159 GMT) would also be affected. \nOn Tuesday, 84 out of a total 1,500 flights will be cancelled, accounting for more than half of the scheduled 170 long-haul flights. \nThat strike, the 13th in 18 months, will only affect Lufthansa flights, the pilots' union said in a statement. \nWednesday's walkout however will include low-cost subsidiary Germanwings. \nUnion and management have been embroiled in a bitter dispute since April 2014 over management plans to change the pilots' early retirement arrangements. \nThe dispute hinges on plans by Lufthansa to scrap an arrangement under which pilots can retire at 55 and receive up to 60 percent of their pay until they reach the statutory retirement age of 65. \nPilots are also concerned about Lufthansa's aim to further develop its low-cost activities as it faces growing competition. \nFollowing the horrific crash of a jet belonging to Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Germanwings in March, the union suspended industrial action. And talks with management have resumed in recent months. \nCockpit said Monday that it has made substantial concessions and accused management of seeking to \"smash wage-agreement structures and demolish protective mechanisms in order to weaken the union.\" \nLufthansa, which also owns Swiss and Austrian Airlines, has embarked on a massive reorganisation, farming out much of its domestic and medium-haul services to its low-cost airline division, Germanwings.",

He is currently being held at HM Prison Wandsworth. \n“It’s not a surprise that Mr Hayes is appealing the sentence given its surprising length,” Stephen Pollard, a London-based lawyer at WilmerHale, told Bloomberg . \n“The Court of Appeal may embrace the opportunity to clarify sentencing parameters for these kinds of cases because there are fewer.” \nHayes was found guilty last month of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud, after a week of deliberations at the end of a two-month trial. \nThe Serious Fraud Office argued that the former derivatives broker at Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) and UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) was at the centre of a network of traders at 10 firms that conspired to manipulate the Libor benchmark between 2006 and 2010. \nMr Justice Cooke told London's Southwark Crown Court that the sentence was intended to send a message to the rest of the banking world. \n\"You played a leading role in the manipulation of Libor. You exerted pressure on others, essentially trained those junior to you in the activity, made corrupt payments to brokers for their assistance,\" said the judge. \n\"The conduct involved here is to be marked out as dishonest and wrong, and a message sent to the world of banking accordingly. The reputation of Libor is important to the City, as a financial sector, and the banking institutions of this City. Probity and honesty is essential, as is trust.\" \n\"The Libor activity, in which you played a leading role, put all that in jeopardy,\" he said. \nSince the Libor scandal was uncovered, more than half a dozen banks have paid billions of pounds in fines and several have fired their chief executives (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

He is currently being held at HM Prison Wandsworth. \n“It’s not a surprise that Mr Hayes is appealing the sentence given its surprising length,” Stephen Pollard, a London-based lawyer at WilmerHale, told Bloomberg . \n“The Court of Appeal may embrace the opportunity to clarify sentencing parameters for these kinds of cases because there are fewer.” \nHayes was found guilty last month of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud, after a week of deliberations at the end of a two-month trial. \nThe Serious Fraud Office argued that the former derivatives broker at Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) and UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) was at the centre of a network of traders at 10 firms that conspired to manipulate the Libor benchmark between 2006 and 2010. \nMr Justice Cooke told London's Southwark Crown Court that the sentence was intended to send a message to the rest of the banking world. \n\"You played a leading role in the manipulation of Libor. You exerted pressure on others, essentially trained those junior to you in the activity, made corrupt payments to brokers for their assistance,\" said the judge. \n\"The conduct involved here is to be marked out as dishonest and wrong, and a message sent to the world of banking accordingly. The reputation of Libor is important to the City, as a financial sector, and the banking institutions of this City. Probity and honesty is essential, as is trust.\" \n\"The Libor activity, in which you played a leading role, put all that in jeopardy,\" he said. \nSince the Libor scandal was uncovered, more than half a dozen banks have paid billions of pounds in fines and several have fired their chief executives (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

The company is also replacing the well-known blue lower case \"g\" icon with an upper-case \"G\" combining blue, green, red and yellow. \nThe 17-year-old Internet company is keen to follow users of its online products onto new generations of Internet-linked devices such as smartphones, tablets and watches. \n\"We're introducing a new logo and identity family that reflects this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens,\" the California-based Internet firm said in a blog post. \n\"We've taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs - such as tap, type and talk.\" \nThe unveiling of the new logo came just weeks after a surprise reorganization of Google under a newly formed parent company called Alphabet. \nThe plan calls for Alphabet to be the corporate parent, with an operating unit for Google and its related search operations, and a handful of other operating firms created for projects in health, Internet delivery, investment and research. \nWhile Google is known as the dominant player in Internet search, it has launched a variety of projects in recent years that are marginally related at best to its core operation. \nThe projects include self-driving cars, Google Glass, Internet balloons, drones, health care, Google TV, mobile payments, home automation and its Google+ social network, among others. \nThe Google unit, to be headed by current company vice president Sundar Pichai, will include search, ads, maps, YouTube, Android and related technology infrastructure.",

The company is also replacing the well-known blue lower case \"g\" icon with an upper-case \"G\" combining blue, green, red and yellow. \nThe 17-year-old Internet company is keen to follow users of its online products onto new generations of Internet-linked devices such as smartphones, tablets and watches. \n\"We're introducing a new logo and identity family that reflects this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens,\" the California-based Internet firm said in a blog post. \n\"We've taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs - such as tap, type and talk.\" \nThe unveiling of the new logo came just weeks after a surprise reorganization of Google under a newly formed parent company called Alphabet. \nThe plan calls for Alphabet to be the corporate parent, with an operating unit for Google and its related search operations, and a handful of other operating firms created for projects in health, Internet delivery, investment and research. \nWhile Google is known as the dominant player in Internet search, it has launched a variety of projects in recent years that are marginally related at best to its core operation. \nThe projects include self-driving cars, Google Glass, Internet balloons, drones, health care, Google TV, mobile payments, home automation and its Google+ social network, among others. \nThe Google unit, to be headed by current company vice president Sundar Pichai, will include search, ads, maps, YouTube, Android and related technology infrastructure.",

        "text": "(Adds background, comment on Ukraine)\nPRAGUE, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Reports of growing Russian military activity in Syria are a cause for concern while the situation in eastern Ukraine seems calmer, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday.\nLebanese sources said on Wednesday Russian forces have begun participating in military operations in Syria in support of government troops.\nStoltenberg joined other western leaders in calling for a political rather than military solution to the four-year-old multi-sided civil war, which has killed 250,000 people and driven half of Syria's 23 million people from their homes.\n\"I am concerned about reports about increased Russian military presence in Syria,\" Stoltenberg told reporters during a visit to Prague. \"That will not contribute to solving the conflict.\n\"I think it is important to support all efforts to find a political solution to the conflict in Syria.\"\nOfficials in the United States, which is fighting an air war against the Islamist militant group Islamic State in Syria but also opposes Bashar Assad's government, have said in recent days that they suspect Russia is reinforcing aid to Assad.\nMoscow confirmed it had \"experts\" on the ground but declined to comment on the exact scale and scope of its military presence.\nGermany's foreign minister warned Russia against increased military intervention, saying a nuclear agreement with Iran and new U.N. initiatives offered a starting point for a political solution. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said reports of Russian troops would complicate efforts to find such a solution.\nSpeaking on the conflict between government forces and Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine, Stoltenberg said an often violated ceasefire seemed to be more observed now than for a long time before, but the situation remained fragile.\nGovernment and separatist representatives agreed in late August to strive to end all violations from last Tuesday.\nPresident Petro Poroshenko said on Tuesday the country still faced the threat of a full-scale Russian military attack despite several days of relative calm.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said reports of Russian troops would complicate efforts to find such a solution.\nSpeaking on the conflict between government forces and Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine, Stoltenberg said an often violated ceasefire seemed to be more observed now than for a long time before, but the situation remained fragile.\nGovernment and separatist representatives agreed in late August to strive to end all violations from last Tuesday.\nPresident Petro Poroshenko said on Tuesday the country still faced the threat of a full-scale Russian military attack despite several days of relative calm.

        "text": "(Updates with source on details and timescale in paragraphs 5-6) \nBy William Schomberg \nLONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Global regulators have reached a draft agreement on a rule on stopping banks from being \"too big to fail\" by requiring them to hold enough equity capital and bonds to avoid taxpayers being called on in a crisis. \nThe proposed standard is known as total loss absorbency capacity or TLAC and Bank of England governor Mark Carney -- who chairs the global regulatory Financial Services Board (FSB) -- has described it as the last major reform after the 2007-09 financial crisis forced governments to shore up lenders. \nThe rule will apply to nearly all the 30 big banks that the FSB has deemed to be \"globally systemic\" such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) and HSBC. \n\"At today's meeting FSB members discussed the TLAC impact assessments, and agreed the draft final principles and the updated term sheet,\" the FSB said in a statement late on Friday. \nThe FSB did not publish details of the agreement, but a source familiar with the deal said it mirrored proposals made at a G20 meeting in Ankara earlier this month. \nThat would see the two-stage introduction of a buffer of debt from 2019 that can be \"bailed in\" to raise equity equivalent to 16 percent of a bank's risk-weighted assets, the source said, rising to 20 percent from 2022. \nThe FSB said members supported consistent implementation of the robust minimum standard, adding that the TLAC standard and its timelines would be finalised by the time of the G20 Summit in November. \nSeparately, the FSB also approved the first version of a similar rule for major insurers, the Higher Loss Absorbency standard, which requires them to hold an extra buffer on top of the basic capital requirements.

Representatives for CPI Card Group didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking comment.\nCPI filed its initial prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 7. It’s planning to go public as U.S. credit-card companies push toward issuing more secure-chip cards.\nThe company makes cards issued for brands including Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover, as well as Interac in Canada, the Aug. 7 prospectus shows.

THOMAS, U.S. Virgin Islands, Sept 8 About 4,500 passengers and crew were stranded in the U.S. Virgin Islands for a second day after an engine fire on board a cruise ship operated by Carnival Corp.\nThe company said on Tuesday that a team of experts, including representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard, had boarded the Carnival Liberty to assess damage to the engine area. There were no injuries to guests or crew.\nPassengers and crew were told to evacuate onshore on Monday after thick black smoke was seen rising from the ship while it was docked in St. Thomas, a Reuters reporter on board the vessel said. Staff distributed water and snacks in the port.\nThe fire was extinguished by the ship's automated suppression system, Carnival said. The cause has yet to be determined and the company has yet to inform passengers of its plans beyond Tuesday.\nThe Carnival Liberty set sail from San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Sunday with 3,346 guests and 1,150 crew on board, Carnival said. It was a day into a week-long Caribbean cruise when the fire broke out.\nPassengers were transferred to nearby hotels, where movies were screened and a buffet was served before returning to spend the night on the ship. On Tuesday, every passenger was offered $150 credit to spend on board and free transportation into town.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said in a statement that marine safety investigators were on the scene in St. Thomas to assess damage and to determine the cause of the fire.\nEngine room fires have disrupted other cruises in recent years.

        "text": "The dollar rose as a U.S. labor report supported expectations that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates when it meets this month.\nThe U.S. currency erased earlier losses as a government release showed American employers added fewer-than-forecast jobs last month while the previous month’s gain was revised up and average hourly earnings rose more than projected. The jobless rate fell to 5.1 percent, the lowest level since April 2008.\n\"The outlook for a stronger dollar remains very much intact,\" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc. in Washington. \"It lays the groundwork for continued dollar buying over the next few weeks.\"\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback versus 10 major peers, added 0.1 percent to 1,213.35 as of 8:52 a.m. in New York. It declined as much as 0.3 percent earlier. The U.S. currency gained 0.1 percent to $1.111 per euro and declined 0.7 percent to 119.26 yen.\nEmployers added 173,000 workers in August. The gain in payrolls, while less than forecast, followed advances in July and June that were stronger than previously reported, the Labor Department said Friday.\nAverage hourly earnings climbed more than forecast and workers put in a longer workweek, the report also showed.\nPersistent hiring indicates employers were upbeat about America’s demand prospects leading up to mounting concerns of further deterioration in emerging economies. Fed policy makers meeting in less than two weeks will weigh resilient U.S. employment conditions against the recent turmoil in world financial markets as they debate the timing of any interest-rate increase.",

        "text_full": "Dollar Strengthens After August Jobs Report Backs Fed Rate Rise\nThe dollar rose as a U.S. labor report supported expectations that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates when it meets this month.\nThe U.S. currency erased earlier losses as a government release showed American employers added fewer-than-forecast jobs last month while the previous month’s gain was revised up and average hourly earnings rose more than projected. The jobless rate fell to 5.1 percent, the lowest level since April 2008.\n\"The outlook for a stronger dollar remains very much intact,\" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc. in Washington. \"It lays the groundwork for continued dollar buying over the next few weeks.\"\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback versus 10 major peers, added 0.1 percent to 1,213.35 as of 8:52 a.m. in New York. It declined as much as 0.3 percent earlier. The U.S. currency gained 0.1 percent to $1.111 per euro and declined 0.7 percent to 119.26 yen.\nEmployers added 173,000 workers in August. The gain in payrolls, while less than forecast, followed advances in July and June that were stronger than previously reported, the Labor Department said Friday.\nAverage hourly earnings climbed more than forecast and workers put in a longer workweek, the report also showed.\nPersistent hiring indicates employers were upbeat about America’s demand prospects leading up to mounting concerns of further deterioration in emerging economies. Fed policy makers meeting in less than two weeks will weigh resilient U.S. employment conditions against the recent turmoil in world financial markets as they debate the timing of any interest-rate increase.",

Target has said it plans to aggressively go after grocery delivery and announced this month that it would begin testing a same-day grocery delivery service with Instacart Inc. in Minneapolis. Amazon, meanwhile, offers a $299-a-year service called AmazonFresh in certain markets.

Quarterly comparable store sales, including fuel and foreign currency impacts, shrank for the first time in almost six years in the third quarter. The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of Canada, Mexico, Korea and Japan could hurt sales and comparable sales, analysts said.

Meanwhile, Tesla will unveil its first electric SUV, the luxury ModelX, intended to broaden the company's offerings beyond its luxury Model S sedan. Business research firm IHS Inc is expected to report higher revenue in the third quarter, helped by growth in its subscription business. IHS, which raised its full-year revenue forecast last quarter, bought mobile network analytics company RootMetrics in April. The company also said it would continue to focus on larger acquisitions and margin expansion. IHS has been looking to its industrials business, the second-biggest revenue contributor, to offset weakness in the energy business.

The new offering would be the first since the Republican governor took office in January.\nInvestors have been demanding fatter yields from the cash-strapped state compared with most other issuers of municipal bonds. Illinois has the lowest credit ratings and worst-funded pension system among the 50 states.\nIts so-called credit spread over Municipal Market Data's benchmark triple-A yield scale is a whopping 195 basis points for GO debt due in 10 years - the widest spread since 2011, according to MMD.\n\"If you throw out Puerto Rico, Illinois is by far the worst state in the nation,\" said Nick Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, referring to the U.S. commonwealth that is struggling to restructure its debt.\nHe added that Illinois' enormous financial problems and \"inept\" government will result in higher debt costs for the state.\nAn impasse between Rauner and Democrats who control the House and Senate has left Illinois without a budget for the fiscal year that began on July 1. Rulings by the Illinois Supreme Court have hamstrung efforts to curb pension costs. As a result, Illinois' credit ratings could fall into the low-investment-grade level of triple-B, which is rare for states.\nAlso on Wednesday, Kelly said Alexis Sturm has been hired as a deputy director in the state budget office, whose responsibilities include debt and capital as well as revenue analysis. Previously, Sturm was research and fiscal reporting director in the Illinois Comptroller's Office.\nIllinois has been without a permanent capital markets director since John Sinsheimer, who was appointed under former Governor Pat Quinn, resigned in February.

Three further banks including MM Warburg are acting in further roles, one of the people said. \nHapag-Lloyd and the banks declined to comment. \nLast month, Hapag-Lloyd decided to prepare for an official announcement of the IPO as early as September, but China's market woes have prompted it to reconsider the timing of the deal, the people said. \n\"The Hapag-Lloyd story needs a strong market, as its business depends on global growth and trade flows,\" one of the people said. \nInvestor (Stockholm: INVE-A.ST - news ) assumptions on the development of the China market crisis and potential effects on the real economy and trade activity are being taken into account when picking a date for the flotation, the person said. \n\"No final decision has been taken, the intention to float may still be published later this month,\" the person said. \nBetween 20 and 40 European listings are scheduled in the next few months, and bankers involved in such deals are hopeful that markets roiled by China's limp growth prospects can be sufficiently soothed.

Three further banks including MM Warburg are acting in further roles, one of the people said. \nHapag-Lloyd and the banks declined to comment. \nLast month, Hapag-Lloyd decided to prepare for an official announcement of the IPO as early as September, but China's market woes have prompted it to reconsider the timing of the deal, the people said. \n\"The Hapag-Lloyd story needs a strong market, as its business depends on global growth and trade flows,\" one of the people said. \nInvestor (Stockholm: INVE-A.ST - news ) assumptions on the development of the China market crisis and potential effects on the real economy and trade activity are being taken into account when picking a date for the flotation, the person said. \n\"No final decision has been taken, the intention to float may still be published later this month,\" the person said. \nBetween 20 and 40 European listings are scheduled in the next few months, and bankers involved in such deals are hopeful that markets roiled by China's limp growth prospects can be sufficiently soothed.

Tepid global demand is also hurting manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy.\nA report on Tuesday showed the manufacturing industry braked to a more than two-year low in August, with some economists blaming the slowdown on the recent global stock market sell-off.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.9 percent in July after a previously reported 1.8 percent increase in June.\nThe dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, which has undercut export growth and weighed on the profits of multinationals.\nOrders for transportation equipment rose 5.5 percent in July as bookings for motor vehicles and parts increased 4.0 percent, the largest gain in a year. Orders for automobiles are likely to remain strong after sales surged in August.\nIn July, there were increases in orders for machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components, and computers and electronic products.\nThe Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - increased 2.1 percent instead of the 2.2 percent rise reported last month.\nShipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.6 percent in July, unchanged from last month's estimate.\nInventories of factory goods slipped 0.1 percent after three straight months of gains. That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio at a lofty 1.35, unchanged from June.\nThat suggests manufacturers might be sitting on a pile of unwanted goods, which could hurt production and weigh on growth in the coming quarters.

        "text": "(Adds details on possible impact, industry comment)\nLOS ANGELES, Sept 1 (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp's U.S. franchisees have voted to begin offering all-day breakfast on Oct. 6, a widely expected move that the company and investors hope will help reverse slumping sales and traffic at the world's biggest fast-food chain.\nMany U.S. consumers like to eat breakfast foods at all hours of the day. McDonald's is the top choice for those so-called \"Breakfastarians,\" according to a recent survey from YouGov BrandIndex, a brand perception research service.\nMcDonald's all-day breakfast menu will include hotcakes, yogurt parfaits, oatmeal, hash browns, sausage burritos and either McMuffin sandwiches or biscuit sandwiches, according to the company, which did not say how much the new program is expected to boost results.\nRichard Adams, a former McDonald's franchisee turned consultant, said McDonald's has told franchisees that all-day breakfast will lure 200 customers a week per restaurant.\nMcDonald's is expected to back its breakfast expansion with a significant advertising campaign, and Adams predicted that the company will get an initial sales boost from expanded breakfast service.\nAll-day sales of McDonald's iconic McMuffin sandwiches at the chain's more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants could increase sales by as much as 2.5 percent a year, according to an internal company presentation obtained by Bloomberg News.\n\"Will this be a long term fix for McDonald's USA? We won't know until well into 2016,\" Adams said.\nSome franchisees worry that extended breakfast service could complicate operations and slow service at a time when company executives have vowed to simplify and streamline the chain's menu.\nTo that end, McDonald's said that regional operators can decide whether to cut certain menu items based on local customer preferences.

McDonald's is the top choice for those so-called \"Breakfastarians,\" according to a recent survey from YouGov BrandIndex, a brand perception research service.\nMcDonald's all-day breakfast menu will include hotcakes, yogurt parfaits, oatmeal, hash browns, sausage burritos and either McMuffin sandwiches or biscuit sandwiches, according to the company, which did not say how much the new program is expected to boost results.\nRichard Adams, a former McDonald's franchisee turned consultant, said McDonald's has told franchisees that all-day breakfast will lure 200 customers a week per restaurant.\nMcDonald's is expected to back its breakfast expansion with a significant advertising campaign, and Adams predicted that the company will get an initial sales boost from expanded breakfast service.\nAll-day sales of McDonald's iconic McMuffin sandwiches at the chain's more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants could increase sales by as much as 2.5 percent a year, according to an internal company presentation obtained by Bloomberg News.\n\"Will this be a long term fix for McDonald's USA? We won't know until well into 2016,\" Adams said.\nSome franchisees worry that extended breakfast service could complicate operations and slow service at a time when company executives have vowed to simplify and streamline the chain's menu.\nTo that end, McDonald's said that regional operators can decide whether to cut certain menu items based on local customer preferences.

REUTERS/Robert … \nBy Dan Levine \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber drivers are entitled to class action status in litigation over whether they are independent contractors or employees, a U.S. judge said on Tuesday, in a ruling in a case that could have wide implications for the sharing economy. \nThree drivers sued Uber in a federal court in San Francisco, contending they are employees and entitled to reimbursement for expenses, including gas and vehicle maintenance. The drivers currently pay those costs themselves. \nIn the ruling, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco said drivers could sue as a group. Such a designation means the suit could cover more than 160,000 California drivers and could give plaintiffs more leverage to negotiate a settlement. \nRepresentatives for Uber and the drivers could not immediately be reached for comment. \nThe results of Uber's legal battle could reshape the sharing economy, as companies say the contractor model allows for flexibility that many see as important to their success. An ultimate finding that drivers are employees could raise Uber's costs beyond the lawsuits' scope and force it to pay Social Security, workers' compensation, and unemployment insurance. \nIn June, a California labour commissioner ruled that an Uber driver was an employee, not a contractor. Uber has appealed that decision. \nThe case is Douglas O'Connor et al vs. Uber Technologies Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 13-3826. \n(Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Tom Brown)",
