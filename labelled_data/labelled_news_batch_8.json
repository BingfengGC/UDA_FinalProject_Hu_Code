Assets in the fund have plunged to $102.8 billion from a peak of $293 billion in April 2013.\nPimco’s main fund, which this year lost the title of the world’s biggest bond mutual fund, has faced record redemptions since the firm’s co-founder Bill Gross left on Sept. 26 for Denver-based Janus Capital Group Inc. The fund, now run by Scott Mather, Mark Kiesel and Mihir Worah, returned 0.2 percent this year, outperforming 67 percent of similarly run funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nOutflows are slowing and the early client withdrawals were to be expected, Dieter Wemmer, chief financial officer at Allianz SE, the German insurer that owns Pimco, said in May.\nThe Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, a passive product tracking a broad fixed-income benchmark, became the world’s biggest bond fund with $118 billion in assets at the end of May. It has lost 0.5 percent this year.\nGross, who co-founded Pimco in 1971 and built it into one of the world’s largest investment firms, departed after losing a power struggle. He now runs the $1.5 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund.",

        "text_full": "Pimco Clients Pulled $3 Billion From Total Return in June\nInvestors pulled money from Pacific Investment Management Co.’s flagship fund last month, the 26th straight month it has experienced redemptions.\nThe $3 billion withdrawal from the Pimco Total Return Fund in June compared with $2.7 billion in May, $5.6 billion in April and $7.3 billion in March, according to the Newport Beach, California-based firm. Assets in the fund have plunged to $102.8 billion from a peak of $293 billion in April 2013.\nPimco’s main fund, which this year lost the title of the world’s biggest bond mutual fund, has faced record redemptions since the firm’s co-founder Bill Gross left on Sept. 26 for Denver-based Janus Capital Group Inc. The fund, now run by Scott Mather, Mark Kiesel and Mihir Worah, returned 0.2 percent this year, outperforming 67 percent of similarly run funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nOutflows are slowing and the early client withdrawals were to be expected, Dieter Wemmer, chief financial officer at Allianz SE, the German insurer that owns Pimco, said in May.\nThe Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, a passive product tracking a broad fixed-income benchmark, became the world’s biggest bond fund with $118 billion in assets at the end of May. It has lost 0.5 percent this year.\nGross, who co-founded Pimco in 1971 and built it into one of the world’s largest investment firms, departed after losing a power struggle. He now runs the $1.5 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund.",

In any case, markets are in for a period of uncertainty and protracted negotiation,\" said Bank of New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) Zealand currency strategist Raiko Shareef. \nThe 'No' vote triggered a rush to safety with the yen being the main beneficiary, with the euro down 1.6 percent against the yen to 134.24 yen, while the U.S. dollar traded at 121.94 yen from 122.80 on Friday. \nThe New Zealand and Australian dollars, often taken as a proxy for risk appetite, also trimmed early losses, but the kiwi was down 0.5 percent, just above a five-year low at $0.6645, while the Aussie was down 0.5 percent at $0.7473, just above a six-year low.",

Paying off the debt restores the enterprise value to the shareholders and that is the number one thing we want to do.” \nMr Hambro said the company may revive its plan to process refractory ore by completing building of processing facilities, which its financial troubles halted. It could also invest in digging deeper into existing mines to access high-quality ore. \nPetropavlovsk may invest up to $50m into work that will allow it to mine existing pits laterally from the side to boost productivity. \nThe company is expected to produce 680,000 ounces of gold this year and sustain production at above 600,000 ounces for the next five years. \nMining companies such as Petropavlovsk were caught out by the gold price crash from a record above $1,930 per ounce a few years ago to around $1,200 now. \nMr Hambro said it remains profitable with a margin of around $500 per ounce, which should generate $300m of revenue this year",

It could also invest in digging deeper into existing mines to access high-quality ore. \nPetropavlovsk may invest up to $50m into work that will allow it to mine existing pits laterally from the side to boost productivity. \nThe company is expected to produce 680,000 ounces of gold this year and sustain production at above 600,000 ounces for the next five years. \nMining companies such as Petropavlovsk were caught out by the gold price crash from a record above $1,930 per ounce a few years ago to around $1,200 now. \nMr Hambro said it remains profitable with a margin of around $500 per ounce, which should generate $300m of revenue this year",

        "text": "A Greek, an Italian and German are born as the crisis that rattled markets from New York to Shanghai was about to unfold: Three nationalities, three very different economic fortunes.\nAt age 3, the German is growing up in an economy that&apos;s already in better shape than when he was born. The Italian will have to wait till she&apos;s 17 to enjoy similar conditions in her own country. The Greek will reach adulthood without any chance of a better future until he&apos;s at least 18.\nBloomberg crunched International Monetary Fund&apos;s data and forecasts, to map out their futures by the numbers in four charts.\n1. When Will it End?\nBabies born in 2007-2008 couldn&apos;t know they were going to grow up in countries that were hurtling into recession. This chart shows how old these kids will be by the time their economies have returned to pre-crisis levels.\n2. Economic Resilience\nThis chart shows how long it will take for economies of Italy and Greece to catch up to pre-crisis levels.\nGermany, the euro region’s powerhouse, recouped lost ground in just three years. By contrast, Greece’s GDP was 25.8 percentage points under the pre-crisis level in 2014.\n 3. Labor Lost\nThe job market is looking pretty dire if you are an Italian girl or Greek boy born in recession times. They might want to move to Germany, where in 2020 unemployment will be half what it is in their own countries. Dial the clock back a decade, it was a very different story. Germany actually had a higher unemployment rate than Greece.\n 4. Farming on the rise?\nFor the first time on record, the contribution of agriculture to the economies of Greece and Italy rose between the crisis and 2014. That represents a U-turn in the century-long process of industrialization. In Germany, industry just got stronger.\n5. Poverty\nIn the meantime, poverty is pervasive in Greece and Italy, forced into severe spending cuts to reduce their deficits. This chart shows what kind of economic fate awaits the children of the lesser (and greater) euro.",

The Italian will have to wait till she&apos;s 17 to enjoy similar conditions in her own country. The Greek will reach adulthood without any chance of a better future until he&apos;s at least 18.\nBloomberg crunched International Monetary Fund&apos;s data and forecasts, to map out their futures by the numbers in four charts.\n1. When Will it End?\nBabies born in 2007-2008 couldn&apos;t know they were going to grow up in countries that were hurtling into recession. This chart shows how old these kids will be by the time their economies have returned to pre-crisis levels.\n2. Economic Resilience\nThis chart shows how long it will take for economies of Italy and Greece to catch up to pre-crisis levels.\nGermany, the euro region’s powerhouse, recouped lost ground in just three years. By contrast, Greece’s GDP was 25.8 percentage points under the pre-crisis level in 2014.\n 3. Labor Lost\nThe job market is looking pretty dire if you are an Italian girl or Greek boy born in recession times. They might want to move to Germany, where in 2020 unemployment will be half what it is in their own countries. Dial the clock back a decade, it was a very different story. Germany actually had a higher unemployment rate than Greece.\n 4. Farming on the rise?\nFor the first time on record, the contribution of agriculture to the economies of Greece and Italy rose between the crisis and 2014. That represents a U-turn in the century-long process of industrialization. In Germany, industry just got stronger.\n5. Poverty\nIn the meantime, poverty is pervasive in Greece and Italy, forced into severe spending cuts to reduce their deficits. This chart shows what kind of economic fate awaits the children of the lesser (and greater) euro.",

Ace buys rival insurer Chubb for $28.3 billion AFP – 6 minutes ago View Photo \n\nSwiss insurer Ace Ltd. announced Wednesday it is buying US rival Chubb in a $28.3 billion cash and stock deal that will create a dominant player in property and casualty insurance. \nThe boards of directors of both companies unanimously approved the deal, they said. The accord would create a giant with shareholder equity of nearly $46 billion and cash, investments and other assets of $150 billion, based on end-2014 data. \n\"Together, ACE and Chubb will create a global leader in commercial and personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, with enhanced growth and earning power and an exceptional balance of products,\" the two said in a statement. \nThey also said that the combination, with a more diverse product line, will reduce their vulnerability to the challenging pricing cycle of the P&C industry. \nAce is a leading commercial insurer in 54 countries, and in the US market is strong in providing insurance for industrial, commercial, multinational and upper middle market companies. \nChubb operates in 25 countries and leads the market in global accident and health services. \n\"We have complementary product strengths -- where one of us is not present, the other is,\" said Ace chairman and chief executive Evan Greenberg. \n\"Where one of us is strong, the other is even stronger. Where there is overlap in product, generally one of us is more present at the large end of the corporate market while the other is serving the smaller or mid-market segment.\" \nThe combined company will adopt the Chubb brand, and be based in Zurich, Switzerland with Greenberg as chairman and CEO. \nChubb shareholders will receive cash and Ace shares worth $124.13 per Chubb share, based on Ace's June 30 closing price. \nThat represents a 30 percent premium on Chubb's closing price Tuesday. \nChubb shares jumped 32.9 percent in early New York Stock exchange trade Wednesday to $126.48. \nAce shares meanwhile added 6.0 percent to $107.79.",

Ace buys rival insurer Chubb for $28.3 billion AFP – 6 minutes ago View Photo \n\nSwiss insurer Ace Ltd. announced Wednesday it is buying US rival Chubb in a $28.3 billion cash and stock deal that will create a dominant player in property and casualty insurance. \nThe boards of directors of both companies unanimously approved the deal, they said. The accord would create a giant with shareholder equity of nearly $46 billion and cash, investments and other assets of $150 billion, based on end-2014 data. \n\"Together, ACE and Chubb will create a global leader in commercial and personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, with enhanced growth and earning power and an exceptional balance of products,\" the two said in a statement. \nThey also said that the combination, with a more diverse product line, will reduce their vulnerability to the challenging pricing cycle of the P&C industry. \nAce is a leading commercial insurer in 54 countries, and in the US market is strong in providing insurance for industrial, commercial, multinational and upper middle market companies. \nChubb operates in 25 countries and leads the market in global accident and health services. \n\"We have complementary product strengths -- where one of us is not present, the other is,\" said Ace chairman and chief executive Evan Greenberg. \n\"Where one of us is strong, the other is even stronger. Where there is overlap in product, generally one of us is more present at the large end of the corporate market while the other is serving the smaller or mid-market segment.\" \nThe combined company will adopt the Chubb brand, and be based in Zurich, Switzerland with Greenberg as chairman and CEO. \nChubb shareholders will receive cash and Ace shares worth $124.13 per Chubb share, based on Ace's June 30 closing price. \nThat represents a 30 percent premium on Chubb's closing price Tuesday. \nChubb shares jumped 32.9 percent in early New York Stock exchange trade Wednesday to $126.48. \nAce shares meanwhile added 6.0 percent to $107.79.",

The aim is to make the world’s second-largest economy a more efficient one, where money gets to its most productive areas.\n“The size of the potential capital flows here may be very large,” Stevens said, adding that it’s very hard to predict how big they’ll be.\nDepth, Quality “But if such flows did happen, it’s going to be very important that the depth and the quality of financial markets in China and around the rest of Asia that might be receiving flows continues to develop,” he said. “That’s a big challenge but one worth meeting and one that would bring considerable benefits both for China, their savers, and also for investors around the region and around the world.”\nAustralia’s links with China have tightened as exports to what is now its largest trading partner almost quadrupled in five years. It exports 5.8 percent of its gross domestic product to China, more than the combined 4.7 percent France sends to Germany and Italy, data from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe RBA has one of three international offices in Beijing - - solely for economic analysis, rather than for trading, which is the main function of the New York and London locations.

Wynn Resorts and other U.S. casino operators have more than $10 billion in projects under construction in Macau scheduled to open over the next two years.\nThe stock fell 1.2 percent to $103.90 at the close in New York. Wynn Resorts has declined 30 percent this year.\nWynn, 73, and his ex-wife Elaine, also 73, each own just under 10 percent of the stock, with him holding about 500,000 more shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",

Learn more... \nSat, Jul 4, 2015, 14:22 BST - UK Markets closed Leighton To Cook Up Wagamama Flotation By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 7 minutes ago View Photo \n\nOne of Britain’s best-known businessmen is to take the helm at Wagamama, the Asian dining chain, ahead of a review that could see it float on the London stock market. \nSky News understands that Allan Leighton, the former boss of Asda and ex-Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) chairman, is to become the restaurant group’s next chairman. \nThe move, to be announced next week, will come four years after Duke Street Capital and Hutton Collins, two investment firms, acquired the business, and is said by insiders to signal the early stages of a plan for them to consider options for their shareholdings. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) the chairman of the Co-operative Group, Mr Leighton is one of the most prominent company directors in the UK. \nHe is in the process of relinquishing of a number of his board roles, including at the set-top box maker Pace (Other OTC: PCMXF - news ) , which has been taken over by Arris, a US rival. \nMr Leighton has also stepped down as chief executive of the Danish jewellery company Pandora (Copenhagen: PNDORA.CO - news ) , and is likely to leave Office, the UK-based footwear retailer, if it is sold as expected later this year. \nWagamama, which means ‘naughty child’ in Japanese, was established by the restaurateur Allan Yau but has been owned by a series of private equity firms for many years. \nIts current owners believe there is still considerable scope to expand the business, which trades from around 150 sites, more than 110 of which are in the UK. \nIn an update to investors in April, Wagamama said that like-for-like sales had risen by almost 10% during its third quarter, with turnover up 18.3% to £47.3m. \nEarlier this year, it raised £150m through a bond issue to accelerate its expansion. \nA Duke Street spokesman declined to comment, while Mr Leighton could not be reached for comment on Saturday.",

The company says it has since resolved the issue by adding capacity. \nCurrency volatility for some emerging countries and soft economic conditions in major economies like China and Europe also likely weighed on sales, analysts say. \nThe company's chips division likely remained the top earner, analysts say, as sales growth for the system chips business is seen making up for the drop in DRAM chip prices for personal computers. \n(Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)",

He will transfer most of those shares, representing about 15 percent of Nike's common stock, to Swoosh, a limited liability company.\nNike said it appointed Knight's son Travis Knight to its board.\nThe company, which Knight co-founded in 1964 with Bill Bowerman, has raced ahead of rivals such as Under Armour Inc and Adidas AG with its Jordan, LeBron and Kobe basketball shoe brands, popular with young Americans.

The bid doesn’t reflect the rising value of K+S’s Legacy potash project in Canada, Chief Executive Officer Norbert Steiner said Thursday, indicating that an offer of at least 50 euros a share would be more appropriate.\nRandy Burton, a spokesman for Potash Corp., declined to comment, as did Kassel, Germany-based K+S, beyond their statements.\nK+S rose 4.4 percent to 38.67 euros Friday in Frankfurt, giving it a market value of 7.4 billion euros. Potash Corp. rose 0.67 percent to C$39.14 at 3:31 p.m. in Toronto.\nLegacy is scheduled to start production by the end of next year and reach 2 million metric tons of capacity from 2017 onward. Its book value is about 11 euros per share, Steiner said Thursday. Taking into account future earnings from the mine, he said it’s worth as much as 21 euros a share.\nK+S Shorts K+S is one of the most shorted stocks in Germany’s benchmark DAX Index, indicating a lack of investor confidence in the company, one of the people familiar with Potash said. At one point in May, short bets accounted for almost a fifth of outstanding shares, according to Markit data. In a short trade, investors bet the shares will decline, allowing them to buy the stock at a lower price.\nA bid of 42.50 euros would result in an 80 percent probability that a deal gets done, according to a note Wednesday from John Klein, an analyst at Berenberg Equity Research.",

That compared with a profit of C$211 million, or 14 Canadians cents per share, in the second quarter of 2014, when the company was hit with impairment charges related to its Joslyn project and other assets.\nOutput from Suncor's northern Alberta operations rose 12 percent to 423,800 barrels per day, mainly due to less unplanned maintenance activity in the quarter.\nCash costs for Suncor's oil sands operations fell to C$28.00 per barrel from C$34.10 in the year-prior quarter, due to the positive impact of increased production, as well as lower natural gas prices and cost reduction initiatives.\nOverall, Suncor produced a total 559,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 8 percent from 518,400 in the second quarter of 2014.\nCash flow, a key indicator of the company's ability to pay for new projects and drilling, fell to C$2.16 billion, or C$1.49 per share, down from C$2.4 billion, or C$1.64, a year ago.\n(Reporting by Julie Gordon ; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

The measure slid 3.4 percent in June, leaving it little changed for the quarter, as Chinese equities in Hong Kong slumped. The city’s stock market is closed Wednesday for a holiday.\nAn official report on China’s manufacturing industry for June will show the quickest expansion since October, while a private factory gauge will signal a fourth month of contraction, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg before data Wednesday. Greece missed a deadline for repaying $1.7 billion to the IMF after bailout talks with its creditors imploded, with investors now awaiting a July 5 vote by its people on whether they support austerity measures.\n“The extreme wariness toward Greece does seem to be fading,” said Hiroichi Nishi, a manager at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “But until the referendum, it’s like annoyingly having a tiny fish bone stuck in the back of your throat.”\nJapan’s Topix index added 0.3 percent after posting a fifth straight quarterly gain. A survey of sentiment among the nation’s large manufacturers beat estimates. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.1 percent after capping a 7.3 percent slide from March through June, its steepest such drop since 2011. The Kospi index gained 0.1 percent in Seoul, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.5 percent.\nChicago futures trading on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is delayed until 8:45 p.m. New York time to account for the leap second. The underlying measure rallied 0.3 percent in New York on Tuesday, following its steepest one-day slump since April 2014. The gauge slid 0.2 percent in the quarter.",

        "text_full": "Asian Stocks Advance After Steepest Monthly Drop Since September\nAsian stocks rose, after the regional benchmark gauge posted its biggest monthly drop since September, as energy and materials shares led gains.\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.1 percent to 146.38 as of 9:01 a.m. in Tokyo. The measure slid 3.4 percent in June, leaving it little changed for the quarter, as Chinese equities in Hong Kong slumped. The city’s stock market is closed Wednesday for a holiday.\nAn official report on China’s manufacturing industry for June will show the quickest expansion since October, while a private factory gauge will signal a fourth month of contraction, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg before data Wednesday. Greece missed a deadline for repaying $1.7 billion to the IMF after bailout talks with its creditors imploded, with investors now awaiting a July 5 vote by its people on whether they support austerity measures.\n“The extreme wariness toward Greece does seem to be fading,” said Hiroichi Nishi, a manager at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “But until the referendum, it’s like annoyingly having a tiny fish bone stuck in the back of your throat.”\nJapan’s Topix index added 0.3 percent after posting a fifth straight quarterly gain. A survey of sentiment among the nation’s large manufacturers beat estimates. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.1 percent after capping a 7.3 percent slide from March through June, its steepest such drop since 2011. The Kospi index gained 0.1 percent in Seoul, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.5 percent.\nChicago futures trading on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is delayed until 8:45 p.m. New York time to account for the leap second. The underlying measure rallied 0.3 percent in New York on Tuesday, following its steepest one-day slump since April 2014. The gauge slid 0.2 percent in the quarter.",

Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.2 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index added 0.2 percent. Markets in China are yet to open.\nChina Futures Futures on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong, and contracts on the Hang Seng Index gained 0.6 percent. FTSE China A50 Index futures were little changed and contracts on the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index climbed 2 percent in recent trading.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee described job gains as “solid,” and it dropped the modifier “somewhat” to describe a decline in labor-market slack. At the same time, policy makers refrained from signaling the probable timing of the first rate increase since 2006, keeping market expectations focused on a move as soon as September.\nFutures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent. The underlying gauge gained 0.7 percent on Wednesday.",

        "text": "July 1 Wayne County, home to Detroit, was under \"probable financial stress,\" the state of Michigan said on Wednesday and announced plans to start a formal fiscal review.\nThe state's Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board said Governor Rick Snyder will appoint a review team that includes Michigan's treasurer and budget director to see if a financial emergency exists.\n\"While county officials have taken some important steps in an effort to remedy the current crisis, the county continues to face significant financial difficulties that must be addressed now,\" State Treasurer Nick Khouri, who chairs the Emergency Loan Board, said in a statement.\nA preliminary review of the county pointed to chronic budget deficits projected to hit $171.4 million by fiscal 2019 and big pension pressures. Since fiscal 2004, the county's pension funding ratio has fallen to 45 percent from nearly 95 percent and the unfunded pension liability has climbed to $910.5 million from just $49.6 million, according to the review.\nDetroit went through a similar process that led to the filing of the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy, which the city exited last December after shedding about $7 billion of its $8 billion of debt and obligations.\nWayne County Executive Warren Evans requested the review last month, asking the state for a fiscal emergency declaration and a consent agreement to fix the problem.\nLast week, the county sold nearly $188 million of taxable notes due on Dec. 1, 2017 with a hefty 6 percent yield and 5.75 percent coupon.

        "text_full": "Michigan sets formal fiscal review of Detroit's county\nJuly 1 Wayne County, home to Detroit, was under \"probable financial stress,\" the state of Michigan said on Wednesday and announced plans to start a formal fiscal review.\nThe state's Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board said Governor Rick Snyder will appoint a review team that includes Michigan's treasurer and budget director to see if a financial emergency exists.\n\"While county officials have taken some important steps in an effort to remedy the current crisis, the county continues to face significant financial difficulties that must be addressed now,\" State Treasurer Nick Khouri, who chairs the Emergency Loan Board, said in a statement.\nA preliminary review of the county pointed to chronic budget deficits projected to hit $171.4 million by fiscal 2019 and big pension pressures. Since fiscal 2004, the county's pension funding ratio has fallen to 45 percent from nearly 95 percent and the unfunded pension liability has climbed to $910.5 million from just $49.6 million, according to the review.\nDetroit went through a similar process that led to the filing of the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy, which the city exited last December after shedding about $7 billion of its $8 billion of debt and obligations.\nWayne County Executive Warren Evans requested the review last month, asking the state for a fiscal emergency declaration and a consent agreement to fix the problem.\nLast week, the county sold nearly $188 million of taxable notes due on Dec. 1, 2017 with a hefty 6 percent yield and 5.75 percent coupon.

The Spanish phone and broadband market has been consolidating since last year after Vodafone Group Plc bought Ono and Orange SA bought Jazztel Plc.\nEuskaltel provided phone and Internet services to more than 870,000 households and almost 150,000 businesses as of the end of March. The name Euskaltel derives from the word Euskad, the name for the Basque Country in the local language.\nExisting shareholders, including International Cable BV and Kutxabank SA, sold about 64 percent of Euskaltel in the listing, excluding a so-called over-allotment option, according to the company.",

        "text": "Print \nLONDON (ShareCast) - Sovereign bond yields retreated amid hopes that a last-minute understanding between Greece and its creditors was still possible. Reports, later confirmed, surfaced shortly after midday that Greece was reconsidering a proposal made late on Monday by European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker. \nThe key aspect of that \"proposal\" was the inclusion of a commitment to evaluate a softening of the terms on the Mediterranean country´s debt pile in October. \nLater in the afternoon however, reports indicated that German chancellor Angela Merkel had said that no new agreement was possible until after the Greek referendum on 5 July, although another Eurogroup meeting had been scheduled for 18:00 on Tuesday. \nCredit-default swap contracts on Greek debt were putting the probability of a default by the country within five years at 88%, versus 71% as of Friday. \nThat came as 10-year Greek government bond yields edged higher by another 35 basis points to 15.42%, while euro/dollar was 0.76% lower to reach 1.1149. \nTo take note of, some analysts had begun to highlight how a \"reversible\" euro, where countries could indeed be forced out, was indeed a 'negative' for the currency, albeit perhaps more on a medium-term basis. \nIronically, the euro was on track for its first quarterly advance since the start of 2014, after having risen by approximately 4%. \nYields on 10-year Gilts and benchmark US Treasury notes slipped slightly lower following the sharp drops seen on the previous day. \nBoth were lower by one basis point to 2.02% and 2.31%, respectively. \nFed funds futures were pricing in a 28% probability of a first rate hike by the US Federal Reserve by September, down from 38% on 26 June.",

        "text_full": "Bonds: Traders tense ahead of Eurogroup meeting, September Fed hike seen less likely\nPrint \nLONDON (ShareCast) - Sovereign bond yields retreated amid hopes that a last-minute understanding between Greece and its creditors was still possible. Reports, later confirmed, surfaced shortly after midday that Greece was reconsidering a proposal made late on Monday by European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker. \nThe key aspect of that \"proposal\" was the inclusion of a commitment to evaluate a softening of the terms on the Mediterranean country´s debt pile in October. \nLater in the afternoon however, reports indicated that German chancellor Angela Merkel had said that no new agreement was possible until after the Greek referendum on 5 July, although another Eurogroup meeting had been scheduled for 18:00 on Tuesday. \nCredit-default swap contracts on Greek debt were putting the probability of a default by the country within five years at 88%, versus 71% as of Friday. \nThat came as 10-year Greek government bond yields edged higher by another 35 basis points to 15.42%, while euro/dollar was 0.76% lower to reach 1.1149. \nTo take note of, some analysts had begun to highlight how a \"reversible\" euro, where countries could indeed be forced out, was indeed a 'negative' for the currency, albeit perhaps more on a medium-term basis. \nIronically, the euro was on track for its first quarterly advance since the start of 2014, after having risen by approximately 4%. \nYields on 10-year Gilts and benchmark US Treasury notes slipped slightly lower following the sharp drops seen on the previous day. \nBoth were lower by one basis point to 2.02% and 2.31%, respectively. \nFed funds futures were pricing in a 28% probability of a first rate hike by the US Federal Reserve by September, down from 38% on 26 June.",

        "text": "Print More than a year after the oil-price slump began, traders are desperate to determine whether U.S. crude-oil production has started to decline in response to low prices. Mixed and delayed data from the federal government have added to the uncertainty. \nMarket watchers are hoping the next monthly government report, which will offer the first data for May, will help clear up some of the confusion. Here are five things to watch when the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the data-gathering arm of the Energy Department, releases its Petroleum Supply Monthly, expected at 2 p.m. EDT on Friday. \n#1: Production May Have Peaked \nThe EIA forecast in early July that production peaked in April and fell by 50,000 barrels a day in May. If that’s confirmed, it could be a signal to traders that production is definitely headed lower in the second half of the year. \n#2: Output Revisions \nThe EIA is able to revise its monthly data for as many as two years, based on new information from state-level agencies. Last month’s report showed April production at a 44-year high of 9.7 million barrels a day. If output levels from past months are revised higher, that could weigh on the oil-futures market. \n#3: Keep an Eye on Texas \nOne of the most important production numbers is also the least reliable. Texas, the state with the most oil output, is slow to provide comprehensive data. The EIA adjusts the state’s preliminary figures to account for reporting delays, which means the most recent Texas numbers are particularly vulnerable to revision. Consulting firm PIRA Energy Group says its April production figure is 9.3 million barrels a day, 400,000 barrels a day lower than the EIA’s, due to its adjustment of Texas data. \n#4: Growing Demand \nThe EIA reported strong U.S. demand for gasoline and other fuels through April, and many analysts expect that trend to continue in May, as more drivers hit the road at the start of summer. \n#5: Update on Exports \nU.S. exports of all petroleum products have soared in recent months as producers sought new markets to absorb the glut of crude oil. Total exports hit a record high of 4.9 million barrels a day in April. More from The Wall Street Journal",

        "text": "Sentiment among Japanese large manufacturers improved for the first time in three quarters in June, a positive sign that runs counter to indications of a slowing economic recovery.\nThe Bank of Japan’s Tankan big manufacturer index rose to 15 from 12 in March, beating economists’ forecasts for an unchanged reading. The index is projected to improve to 16 in September, with big companies across all industries planning to boost capital expenditure by 9.3 percent in the year through March 2016, the BOJ said.\nImproved business sentiment could help buttress an economy that BNP Paribas SA says may have slowed this quarter on weaker production and exports . The challenge for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is to get companies to follow through on their investment plans and plow more of their record cash hoard into the world’s third-biggest economy.\n“Japan’s economy is gradually recovering,” Hiroaki Muto, an economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Management Co, said before the report. “Business confidence should get better along with it.”\nExpansion in Japan’s economy is forecast to slow to 1.4 percent in the second quarter from an annualized 3.9 percent in the first three months of the year, a survey shows. JPMorgan Chase & Co. economist Masamichi Adachi predicts the economy will slow to a standstill , while BNP’s Hiroshi Shiraishi says a contraction is possible.\nEconomic Headwinds Abe is trying to sustain a recovery while reining in the world’s heaviest debt burden through spending constraints. More than two years since the Bank of Japan began record monetary stimulus to spur 2 percent inflation, consumer price gains are barely above zero.\nSentiment among large non-manufacturers rose to 23 from 19 three months earlier. The increase in capital expenditure planned by big companies across all industries this fiscal year compares with a cut of 1.2 percent projected three months earlier.\nLarge manufacturers based their plans on the assumption the yen will average 115.62 per dollar in the year through March 2016. The yen was at 122.42 against the dollar as of 9:04 a.m. in Tokyo.\nA weaker yen boosts overseas profits when repatriated to Japan while it increases the cost of imports.\nAbe urged Japanese business leaders in June to make “bold” decisions and step up investment spending. Companies held a record 241 trillion yen of cash and deposits at the end of March.",

        "text_full": "Japanese Manufacturer Confidence Index Unexpectedly Improves\nSentiment among Japanese large manufacturers improved for the first time in three quarters in June, a positive sign that runs counter to indications of a slowing economic recovery.\nThe Bank of Japan’s Tankan big manufacturer index rose to 15 from 12 in March, beating economists’ forecasts for an unchanged reading. The index is projected to improve to 16 in September, with big companies across all industries planning to boost capital expenditure by 9.3 percent in the year through March 2016, the BOJ said.\nImproved business sentiment could help buttress an economy that BNP Paribas SA says may have slowed this quarter on weaker production and exports . The challenge for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is to get companies to follow through on their investment plans and plow more of their record cash hoard into the world’s third-biggest economy.\n“Japan’s economy is gradually recovering,” Hiroaki Muto, an economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Management Co, said before the report. “Business confidence should get better along with it.”\nExpansion in Japan’s economy is forecast to slow to 1.4 percent in the second quarter from an annualized 3.9 percent in the first three months of the year, a survey shows. JPMorgan Chase & Co. economist Masamichi Adachi predicts the economy will slow to a standstill , while BNP’s Hiroshi Shiraishi says a contraction is possible.\nEconomic Headwinds Abe is trying to sustain a recovery while reining in the world’s heaviest debt burden through spending constraints. More than two years since the Bank of Japan began record monetary stimulus to spur 2 percent inflation, consumer price gains are barely above zero.\nSentiment among large non-manufacturers rose to 23 from 19 three months earlier. The increase in capital expenditure planned by big companies across all industries this fiscal year compares with a cut of 1.2 percent projected three months earlier.\nLarge manufacturers based their plans on the assumption the yen will average 115.62 per dollar in the year through March 2016. The yen was at 122.42 against the dollar as of 9:04 a.m. in Tokyo.\nA weaker yen boosts overseas profits when repatriated to Japan while it increases the cost of imports.\nAbe urged Japanese business leaders in June to make “bold” decisions and step up investment spending. Companies held a record 241 trillion yen of cash and deposits at the end of March.",

It traded at 27.25 pence at 8:19 a.m. in London, valuing about 568 million pounds ($892 million).\nA special planning committee voted 8-7 in favor of the mine Tuesday, ending a protracted approval process that has dragged on for years. Sirius says the project will create more than 1,000 jobs and add 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) a year to the British economy.\n“This is really just the beginning for the company,” Chris Fraser, the chief executive officer of Sirius, said in a statement. “We have made a major step forward and now have a pathway to reaching production and unlocking ever more value for our shareholders.”\nThe proposed mine has proved highly contentious and the park’s own planning officers’ final report before Tuesday’s meeting said the economic benefit of mining didn’t outweigh the harm it would cause. The greater public interest is in protecting the park for future generations, the report said, while making no formal recommendation.\n“We have long maintained that this project is completely incompatible with National Park purposes,” the Campaign for National Parks said in a statement after the ruling. “The promised economic benefits could never justify the huge damage that it would do to the area’s landscape and wildlife and to the local tourism economy.”\nTo develop the York potash mine, Sirius plans to dig underground shafts within the 554-square-mile (1,430-square-kilometer) park before boring out the mineral from deposits under the land and the North Sea. The polyhalite would be crushed and processed down the mine before being fed to an underground pipe and taken as slurry to a port 28 miles away.",

Will Martin, a spokesman for the California Guard. \nThe Guard has previously used the drone to support firefighting efforts in 2013 at Yosemite National Park. \n\"For the purpose of collecting imagery, it's unrivaled,\" Martin said of drone technology. \nThe search for Edward Kavanaugh, 45, has intensified in the 12 days since he went missing. Kavanaugh was last seen July 17 driving a motorcycle on a trail through El Dorado County, about three hours east of the San Francisco Bay Area. He was with another driver before cruising off on his own. \nKavanaugh is a popular veteran teacher who works for San Francisco Unified School District. \nMartin said the drone has yet to provide any new leads in Kavanaugh's disappearance. \nOfficials have gathered more than 50 volunteers to help sweep El Dorado and neighboring counties by foot, car and helicopter.",

Learn more... \nWed, Jul 1, 2015, 13:35 BST - UK Markets close in 2 hrs 55 mins German rail operator, train drivers end wage dispute AFP – 26 minutes ago View Photo \n\nGerman national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, said Wednesday it has finally reached a deal with the train drivers' union GDL, putting an end to a long-running dispute that has caused months of chaos and misery for rail passengers around the country. \n\"Mediation between Deutsche Bahn and GDL has been successfully concluded. Both sides have agreed to the mediators' proposals,\" the company said in a statement. \nManagement has been locked in a fierce battle with GDL for many months, during which drivers staged multiple walkouts, paralysing rail travel across most of the country for days at a time. \nThe GDL, which represents some 20,000 train drivers, had been demanding a wage rise and shorter work hours as well as the right to represent other rail workers such as conductors and restaurant carriage staff. \nThat demand was effectively a turf war with the larger railway union EVG, which has more than 200,000 members, and which reached a separate wage deal in less heated negotiations in May. \nUnder the latest settlement, GDL members will receive the same pay rise and one-off bonus concluded with EVG. \nThe 5.1 percent pay rise will be effected in two stages, and remain valid until September 2016. \nIn order to reduce by December 2017 the huge number of overtime hours that train drivers had built up, 300 new drivers would be hired. \nWeekly working hours, meantime, would be reduced from 39 hours to 38 hours from 2018. \nDeutsch Bahn's personnel chief Ulrich Weber described the deal as a \"fair compromise.\" \nWith the spectre of further strikes now banished, \"that is an important signal for our customers, our employees and the entire company,\" Weber said. \n\"Everyone can now buy their train tickets for the holiday\" period, said one of the two mediators, Bodo Ramelow, at a news conference.",

Learn more... \nWed, Jul 1, 2015, 13:35 BST - UK Markets close in 2 hrs 55 mins German rail operator, train drivers end wage dispute AFP – 26 minutes ago View Photo \n\nGerman national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, said Wednesday it has finally reached a deal with the train drivers' union GDL, putting an end to a long-running dispute that has caused months of chaos and misery for rail passengers around the country. \n\"Mediation between Deutsche Bahn and GDL has been successfully concluded. Both sides have agreed to the mediators' proposals,\" the company said in a statement. \nManagement has been locked in a fierce battle with GDL for many months, during which drivers staged multiple walkouts, paralysing rail travel across most of the country for days at a time. \nThe GDL, which represents some 20,000 train drivers, had been demanding a wage rise and shorter work hours as well as the right to represent other rail workers such as conductors and restaurant carriage staff. \nThat demand was effectively a turf war with the larger railway union EVG, which has more than 200,000 members, and which reached a separate wage deal in less heated negotiations in May. \nUnder the latest settlement, GDL members will receive the same pay rise and one-off bonus concluded with EVG. \nThe 5.1 percent pay rise will be effected in two stages, and remain valid until September 2016. \nIn order to reduce by December 2017 the huge number of overtime hours that train drivers had built up, 300 new drivers would be hired. \nWeekly working hours, meantime, would be reduced from 39 hours to 38 hours from 2018. \nDeutsch Bahn's personnel chief Ulrich Weber described the deal as a \"fair compromise.\" \nWith the spectre of further strikes now banished, \"that is an important signal for our customers, our employees and the entire company,\" Weber said. \n\"Everyone can now buy their train tickets for the holiday\" period, said one of the two mediators, Bodo Ramelow, at a news conference.",

        "text": "Ukraine will finish 2015 as the biggest loser in global growth, according to forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nThe conflict-battered eastern European nation will see its gross domestic product contract 4 percent in the fourth quarter from the same time in 2014, the worst of 47 economies polled by Bloomberg in April through June. The ill fortune will be shared by neighboring Russia, where GDP will shrink 3.5 percent by year-end amid international sanctions and depressed oil revenue. Here&apos;s how those two stack up among the 10 biggest GDP losers:\nParts of Latin America also will be struggling on the eve of 2016. Brazil and Argentina, each suffering from soaring inflation and unemployment , will see year-over-year contractions of 1.6 percent and 1.5 percent, the poll data show. Brazil saw the biggest downgrade among the 28 economies that were included in Bloomberg&apos;s January survey. At that time, South America&apos;s powerhouse was expected to grow 1 percent this year.\nSwitzerland, still reeling from the Swiss National Bank&apos;s January decision to scrap its franc-euro cap, clocked in at No. 5 on the unfavorable GDP list, expected to eke out growth of 0.1 percent. As its evolving financial crisis grabs international attention, Greece&apos;s standing at No. 8 could be precarious; economists projected in April that the country would expand 0.9 percent at the end of 2015.\nRounding out the dismal 10 were Croatia, Serbia, Italy and Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan, whose biggest trading partner is Russia, is now expected to grow 1.2 percent, having plunged from the 3.6 percent economists projected three months ago.\nOn the other end of the scale, Vietnam joins emerging economies India and China for the three fastest-growing economies by year-end.\nCurrent forecasts are the median from each country&apos;s June survey except for Croatia and Greece, for which the last survey was in April, and Serbia, which was in May. The figures at the start of 2015 come from the countries&apos; January surveys, except for Ukraine and Kazakhstan (March), and Vietnam (December). That brought the total number of economies surveyed to 47.",

The ill fortune will be shared by neighboring Russia, where GDP will shrink 3.5 percent by year-end amid international sanctions and depressed oil revenue. Here&apos;s how those two stack up among the 10 biggest GDP losers:\nParts of Latin America also will be struggling on the eve of 2016. Brazil and Argentina, each suffering from soaring inflation and unemployment , will see year-over-year contractions of 1.6 percent and 1.5 percent, the poll data show. Brazil saw the biggest downgrade among the 28 economies that were included in Bloomberg&apos;s January survey. At that time, South America&apos;s powerhouse was expected to grow 1 percent this year.\nSwitzerland, still reeling from the Swiss National Bank&apos;s January decision to scrap its franc-euro cap, clocked in at No. 5 on the unfavorable GDP list, expected to eke out growth of 0.1 percent. As its evolving financial crisis grabs international attention, Greece&apos;s standing at No. 8 could be precarious; economists projected in April that the country would expand 0.9 percent at the end of 2015.\nRounding out the dismal 10 were Croatia, Serbia, Italy and Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan, whose biggest trading partner is Russia, is now expected to grow 1.2 percent, having plunged from the 3.6 percent economists projected three months ago.\nOn the other end of the scale, Vietnam joins emerging economies India and China for the three fastest-growing economies by year-end.\nCurrent forecasts are the median from each country&apos;s June survey except for Croatia and Greece, for which the last survey was in April, and Serbia, which was in May. The figures at the start of 2015 come from the countries&apos; January surveys, except for Ukraine and Kazakhstan (March), and Vietnam (December). That brought the total number of economies surveyed to 47.",

        "text": "SYDNEY, July 1 The euro got off to a cautious start in Asia on Wednesday with Greece's fate still hanging in the balance after it became the first advanced economy to ever be in arrears to the International Monetary Fund.\nThe common currency eased 0.2 percent to $1.1128, having suffered a 0.8 percent drop on Tuesday.

The company has no immediate plans to create domestic ETFs in Japan, it said.\nWisdomTree has more than $63 billion in assets. Its Japan Hedged Equity Fund is the second-largest U.S. ETF tracking Japanese stocks, with $18.1 billion under management, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n“WisdomTree is a firm of thoughtful, research-driven investment solutions,” Koll said in the statement. “I am excited to help bring this story to Japan.”\nJPMorgan hired Koll, a former chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. and hedge fund manager, to head its Japanese stock strategy team in November 2009. He resigned at the end of March to pursue a “new career opportunity,” he wrote in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg. JPMorgan promoted Hisashi Moriyama in his place.\nKoll was previously chief economist at JPMorgan between 1994 and 1998, before moving to hedge fund Tiger Management LLC and then Merrill in 1999. Koll rejoined JPMorgan after stepping down as chief executive officer at Tokyo-based Tantallon Research Japan, a hedge fund started in 2007 just months before the nation fell into recession.\nA German who speaks fluent Japanese, Koll became a resident of Japan in 1986.\nJPMorgan has its own plans after Koll’s departure. It’s seeking to increase the number of analysts in Tokyo to 25 from 15 and focus more on stock-picking, Moriyama said in an interview Tuesday, as it seeks to become Japan’s highest-ranked foreign brokerage.",

        "text_full": "WisdomTree Names Jesper Koll to Head ETF Maker’s Japan Unit\nJesper Koll, former head of equity research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo, will join WisdomTree Investments Inc. as chief executive officer in Japan.\nKoll will help open a Tokyo office for WisdomTree that is expected to start business later this year, the exchange-traded fund manager said in a statement Wednesday. The company has no immediate plans to create domestic ETFs in Japan, it said.\nWisdomTree has more than $63 billion in assets. Its Japan Hedged Equity Fund is the second-largest U.S. ETF tracking Japanese stocks, with $18.1 billion under management, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n“WisdomTree is a firm of thoughtful, research-driven investment solutions,” Koll said in the statement. “I am excited to help bring this story to Japan.”\nJPMorgan hired Koll, a former chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. and hedge fund manager, to head its Japanese stock strategy team in November 2009. He resigned at the end of March to pursue a “new career opportunity,” he wrote in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg. JPMorgan promoted Hisashi Moriyama in his place.\nKoll was previously chief economist at JPMorgan between 1994 and 1998, before moving to hedge fund Tiger Management LLC and then Merrill in 1999. Koll rejoined JPMorgan after stepping down as chief executive officer at Tokyo-based Tantallon Research Japan, a hedge fund started in 2007 just months before the nation fell into recession.\nA German who speaks fluent Japanese, Koll became a resident of Japan in 1986.\nJPMorgan has its own plans after Koll’s departure. It’s seeking to increase the number of analysts in Tokyo to 25 from 15 and focus more on stock-picking, Moriyama said in an interview Tuesday, as it seeks to become Japan’s highest-ranked foreign brokerage.",

        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, July 30 Location-tracking devices that communicate with a major satellite network operated by Globalstar Inc can have their transmissions intercepted or mimicked with false data, a U.S. security researcher said on Thursday.\nGlobalstar, of Covington, Louisiana, has sold hundreds of thousands or millions of the devices, which are widely used for tracking valuable shipments and assets.\nThe problem is that unlike Globalstar's satellite phone services, data from the devices is not encrypted in transit, said Synack Inc researcher Colby Moore, who will present his findings at next week's Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas.\nInstead, the system changes frequencies and transmits a great deal of inconsequential data that can be discarded once an attacker figures out the methods involved, as Moore did.\nSuch systems \"are kind of fundamentally broken from the get-go,\" Moore said in a phone interview. \"I ended up figuring out how to decode the data in transit.\" In addition, the system does not make sure that the data is coming from the place it claims.\nThe flaw is an architectural issue that Moore said would be hard or impossible to patch. New software could be written to encrypt the traffic in future devices, but the technology is already embedded inside popular hardware without that functionality and no clear way to install it.\nGlobalstar representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\nMoore said his work would be easy to replicate and that organized crime, intelligence agencies or others may already be eavesdropping on the network.\nTracking-system devices using the Globalstar network are handy for monitoring shipments, sending longitude and latitude coordinates through dozens of low-earth orbiting satellites. They can also carried by travelers and used for search-and-rescue missions.\nSome devices send additional binary signals, for example reporting whether whether an alarm has been tripped, which can also be intercepted and decoded or imitated with false information.\nMajor oil and gas companies are among Globalstar's customers. Moore said he did not know how many other satellite networks could have similar vulnerability to eavesdropping or faked traffic. (Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Tom Brown )",

        "text_full": "Globalstar location-tracking network vulnerable to hacking - researcher\nSAN FRANCISCO, July 30 Location-tracking devices that communicate with a major satellite network operated by Globalstar Inc can have their transmissions intercepted or mimicked with false data, a U.S. security researcher said on Thursday.\nGlobalstar, of Covington, Louisiana, has sold hundreds of thousands or millions of the devices, which are widely used for tracking valuable shipments and assets.\nThe problem is that unlike Globalstar's satellite phone services, data from the devices is not encrypted in transit, said Synack Inc researcher Colby Moore, who will present his findings at next week's Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas.\nInstead, the system changes frequencies and transmits a great deal of inconsequential data that can be discarded once an attacker figures out the methods involved, as Moore did.\nSuch systems \"are kind of fundamentally broken from the get-go,\" Moore said in a phone interview. \"I ended up figuring out how to decode the data in transit.\" In addition, the system does not make sure that the data is coming from the place it claims.\nThe flaw is an architectural issue that Moore said would be hard or impossible to patch. New software could be written to encrypt the traffic in future devices, but the technology is already embedded inside popular hardware without that functionality and no clear way to install it.\nGlobalstar representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\nMoore said his work would be easy to replicate and that organized crime, intelligence agencies or others may already be eavesdropping on the network.\nTracking-system devices using the Globalstar network are handy for monitoring shipments, sending longitude and latitude coordinates through dozens of low-earth orbiting satellites. They can also carried by travelers and used for search-and-rescue missions.\nSome devices send additional binary signals, for example reporting whether whether an alarm has been tripped, which can also be intercepted and decoded or imitated with false information.\nMajor oil and gas companies are among Globalstar's customers. Moore said he did not know how many other satellite networks could have similar vulnerability to eavesdropping or faked traffic. (Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Tom Brown )",

While the Shanghai Composite Index extended its declines on Friday, the analyst upgraded her rating of the nation’s biggest brokerage, Citic Securities Co., to “buy” from “reduce.”\nThe benchmark fell below the 4,000 level on Thursday for the first time since April, as investors trading with borrowed money continued to unwind their positions.",

While the Shanghai Composite Index extended its declines on Friday, the analyst upgraded her rating of the nation’s biggest brokerage, Citic Securities Co., to “buy” from “reduce.”\nThe benchmark fell below the 4,000 level on Thursday for the first time since April, as investors trading with borrowed money continued to unwind their positions.",

He said any deal between Greece and its creditors must take into account “consistent implementation of reforms” by the nation as well as what is feasible for the Greek people.\nGreece this week became the first advanced economy to miss payment to the International Monetary Fund after closing its banks ahead of a referendum on austerity. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who’s urging citizens to vote “no,” made a bid for a compromise with creditors Wednesday that was rejected by the euro region.\n“We’ve seen some very positive examples in Europe,” Oudea said. “If you take Ireland for example, it’s implemented reform, it went through difficult times, but it’s got much better. You could talk about Spain as well.”\nFor now, markets indicate investors trust policy makers’ efforts to keep Greece in the euro after more than five years of crisis and two bailouts. The currency strengthened 3.9 percent against the dollar in the three months ended June, the biggest gain in seven quarters.\nOudea said he expects the euro will weaken slightly in the next 18 months to about 1.05 per dollar. The shared currency traded at 1.1048 at 11:01 a.m. in Tokyo.",

        "text_full": "Societe Generale CEO Says Europe Can Handle Any Greece Scenario\nSociete Generale SA’s chief executive officer downplayed any risk of Greece’s financial crisis rippling through Europe, saying banks and the economy are in much better shape than when the issue flared up five years ago.\n“Whatever the scenario is at the end of the day, the euro zone can handle this scenario,” CEO Frederic Oudea said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Yvonne Man in Hong Kong. “The situation in terms of the structure of the banks, the exposure to Greece and the Greek economy is totally different.”\nOudea, 51, said that the European Central Bank’s purchases of sovereign debt in the region will limit any risk of contagion. He said any deal between Greece and its creditors must take into account “consistent implementation of reforms” by the nation as well as what is feasible for the Greek people.\nGreece this week became the first advanced economy to miss payment to the International Monetary Fund after closing its banks ahead of a referendum on austerity. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who’s urging citizens to vote “no,” made a bid for a compromise with creditors Wednesday that was rejected by the euro region.\n“We’ve seen some very positive examples in Europe,” Oudea said. “If you take Ireland for example, it’s implemented reform, it went through difficult times, but it’s got much better. You could talk about Spain as well.”\nFor now, markets indicate investors trust policy makers’ efforts to keep Greece in the euro after more than five years of crisis and two bailouts. The currency strengthened 3.9 percent against the dollar in the three months ended June, the biggest gain in seven quarters.\nOudea said he expects the euro will weaken slightly in the next 18 months to about 1.05 per dollar. The shared currency traded at 1.1048 at 11:01 a.m. in Tokyo.",
