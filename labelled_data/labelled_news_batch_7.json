        "text": "(Adds industry data, executive's comments, sales by brand)\nSAO PAULO, July 6 (Reuters) - Auto production in Brazil tumbled in June to the lowest level since January 2009, putting more jobs at risk in the country's fragile car industry and undermining hopes for an economic recovery.\nOutput of cars, trucks and buses dropped 12.5 percent and sales slipped 0.1 percent in June from May despite two extra weekdays, the national automakers' association Anfavea said on Monday. Compared to a year ago, auto output fell 14.8 percent and sales plunged 19.4 percent.\nWith no sign of demand rebounding amid higher interest rates and inflation, automakers are trying to limit losses by cutting deeper into payrolls, which have shrunk 8 percent in the past 12 months.\nBrazil is one of the world's five biggest auto markets and a major base of operations for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.\nAutomakers in Brazil produced about 184,000 new cars and trucks last month, the weakest since roughly 180,000 vehicles in January 2009, near the depths of the global financial crisis.\nAutomakers, which contribute about a fifth of Brazil's industrial output, have also struggled to sell cars without tax incentives that President Dilma Rousseff cut this year as part of an unpopular austerity program.\nWith inventories of nearly 340,000 vehicles sitting idle, Anfavea President Luiz Moan said car makers would continue to limit production at least through the end of August.\nAround 36,000 workers in the auto industry, or about a quarter of the total workforce, are on paid leave, Moan said, underscoring the fragile situation for many workers.\nAccording to Anfavea data, Fiat remained Brazil's top seller of cars and light trucks in June, with about 36,700 new registrations. VW stole second place from GM with around 30,100 sales, ahead of its U.S. rival's nearly 27,500 new registrations. Ford sold around 20,400 vehicles.

Compared to a year ago, auto output fell 14.8 percent and sales plunged 19.4 percent.\nWith no sign of demand rebounding amid higher interest rates and inflation, automakers are trying to limit losses by cutting deeper into payrolls, which have shrunk 8 percent in the past 12 months.\nBrazil is one of the world's five biggest auto markets and a major base of operations for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.\nAutomakers in Brazil produced about 184,000 new cars and trucks last month, the weakest since roughly 180,000 vehicles in January 2009, near the depths of the global financial crisis.\nAutomakers, which contribute about a fifth of Brazil's industrial output, have also struggled to sell cars without tax incentives that President Dilma Rousseff cut this year as part of an unpopular austerity program.\nWith inventories of nearly 340,000 vehicles sitting idle, Anfavea President Luiz Moan said car makers would continue to limit production at least through the end of August.\nAround 36,000 workers in the auto industry, or about a quarter of the total workforce, are on paid leave, Moan said, underscoring the fragile situation for many workers.\nAccording to Anfavea data, Fiat remained Brazil's top seller of cars and light trucks in June, with about 36,700 new registrations. VW stole second place from GM with around 30,100 sales, ahead of its U.S. rival's nearly 27,500 new registrations. Ford sold around 20,400 vehicles.

A deepening slowdown in China’s steel industry and higher iron ore exports from the largest miners are weighing on prices, said Sanford C.

Recent losses followed figures showing inventories in China rebounded, while exports in June from Australia’s Port Hedland were at a record. The Minerals Council of Australia on Tuesday defended local miners’ policy of adding output, saying cuts would be a failed strategy that would aid competitors.\n“Momentum is clearly negative and that is going to be hard to reverse in the immediate short term,” Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein in London, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. “The revealed preference of the miners is for volume over value, for tons ahead of price.”\nOre with 62 percent content delivered to Qingdao sank 5.4 percent to $52.28 a dry ton on Monday, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd.

They’d rebounded from the decade-low of $47.08 on April 2 after shipments missed expectations and port stockpiles fell.\n“In recent weeks, we have seen trade pick up,” said Jeremy Sussman, a mining analyst at Clarksons in New York. “If this continues, we think iron ore can continue going lower,” he said, reiterating a view that the price may slump to $40.",

But uncertainty abroad has increased and it is difficult to assess the consequences of the situation in Greece,\" the bank said in a statement. \n\"In this uncertain environment, monetary policy needs to be even more expansionary to ensure that inflation continues to rise towards the target of 2.0 percent,\" it said. \nThe Riksbank has been trying to lift inflation since it stalled at the end of 2012, and has kept the repo rate in negative territory, which encourages spending, since February. \nSweden, like the neighbouring eurozone, has been concerned about the threat of deflation. Long spells of falling prices can be extremely destructive for economies if consumers start to postpone purchases in hopes of better deals, as that can set off a spiral of job, wage and output cuts that further reduce prices. \nThe Riksbank said its expansionary policy was having the desired effect with inflation, excluding mortgage rates, ticking in at 1.0 percent in May and expected to be close to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. \n\"Prices of goods and food are increasing in line with historical averages, while the rate of price increase on services is rising from a low level,\" it said. \nThe bank said economic activity was also continuing to strengthen and the situation on the labour market was gradually improving. \nIt also said it was extending the purchases of government bonds by a further 45 billion kronor (4.81 billion euros, $5.32 billion) with effect from September and until the end of the year.",

However, it no longer has any nomad clients after the last one, Forum Energy (LSE: FEP.L - news ) , was taken private by Philex Petroleum. Forum's shares were cancelled from Aim on June 25. \nAnother client, NAHL Group (LSE: NAH.L - news ) , parted ways in May as Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) became its sole broker. \nThere are now 39 nomads registered with the London Stock Exchange Group, which runs Aim. Three of these advisers PwC, HSBC, Deloitte have no current nomad clients, while several large investment banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have recently withdrawn their services from the junior stock market. \nMarcus Stuttard, the head of Aim, recently said the drop-off in advisers had cleared out “a long tail of inactive nomads”. \nAim is the listing venue for more than a thousand small-cap and fast-growing companies. The market has helped firms to raise £90bn since its inception 20 years ago, although it has faced criticism for price growth that has lagged behind other global markets.",

Learn more... \nMon, Jul 6, 2015, 15:22 BST - UK Markets close in 1 hr 8 mins London's junior stock market Aim loses another nominated adviser By Marion Dakers | Telegraph – 18 minutes ago 0.00 \nExecution Noble could reapply to advise Aim firms at a later date \nLondon’s Alternative Investment Market has lost another of its corporate advisers, at least temporarily, as the pool of City firms working with the junior market continues to shrink. \nExecution Noble, which became part of the Portuguese group Espirito Santo in 2010, has asked for its status as a nominated adviser (nomad) to be removed with immediate effect. \nThe move is thought to be linked to the imminent takeover of Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento, the nomad’s parent entity, by Haitong Securities of China. \nExecution Noble is free to reapply for nomad status with the stock market once the Haitong deal completes. However, it no longer has any nomad clients after the last one, Forum Energy (LSE: FEP.L - news ) , was taken private by Philex Petroleum. Forum's shares were cancelled from Aim on June 25. \nAnother client, NAHL Group (LSE: NAH.L - news ) , parted ways in May as Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) became its sole broker. \nThere are now 39 nomads registered with the London Stock Exchange Group, which runs Aim. Three of these advisers PwC, HSBC, Deloitte have no current nomad clients, while several large investment banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have recently withdrawn their services from the junior stock market. \nMarcus Stuttard, the head of Aim, recently said the drop-off in advisers had cleared out “a long tail of inactive nomads”. \nAim is the listing venue for more than a thousand small-cap and fast-growing companies. The market has helped firms to raise £90bn since its inception 20 years ago, although it has faced criticism for price growth that has lagged behind other global markets.",

UK's Bramley apple filling gains EU protection as traditional delicacy Reuters - UK Focus – 24 minutes ago Print \nBRUSSELS, July 29 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday said it would register Britain's \"traditional Bramley apple pie filling\" as a protected historical delicacy in the European Union. \nThe British pie filling is a blend of fresh Bramley apples, sugar, and water. It may optionally contain Bramley apple puree, corn flour, and lemon juice. \nThe register will put traditional Bramley apple pie filling on a par with Italy's Mozzarella cheese and Belgium's lambic beer. \nThe Bramley apple dates from the 19th century and was first exhibited by London's Royal Horticultural Society in 1876, the Commission said. In 1883, the National Apple Congress acclaimed the apple as the best suited variety for apple pies. \nEver since, the recipe for traditional Bramley apple pie filling has remained unchanged. The acidic variety is rarely eaten fresh but lends itself well to baking and cooking. \nA farm product may be registered as \"Traditional Specialties Guaranteed\" (TSG) by the EU only if it is produced using traditional raw materials and prepared with traditional methods. \nTSG designation boosts farmer revenues as it increases the market value of the products registered, the Commission said. \nUK Apples & Pears Ltd, which represents three quarters of British producers, applied for TSG recognition in March, arguing that other pie fillings may contain a mix of apple varieties and artificial preservatives.

UK's Bramley apple filling gains EU protection as traditional delicacy Reuters - UK Focus – 24 minutes ago Print \nBRUSSELS, July 29 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday said it would register Britain's \"traditional Bramley apple pie filling\" as a protected historical delicacy in the European Union. \nThe British pie filling is a blend of fresh Bramley apples, sugar, and water. It may optionally contain Bramley apple puree, corn flour, and lemon juice. \nThe register will put traditional Bramley apple pie filling on a par with Italy's Mozzarella cheese and Belgium's lambic beer. \nThe Bramley apple dates from the 19th century and was first exhibited by London's Royal Horticultural Society in 1876, the Commission said. In 1883, the National Apple Congress acclaimed the apple as the best suited variety for apple pies. \nEver since, the recipe for traditional Bramley apple pie filling has remained unchanged. The acidic variety is rarely eaten fresh but lends itself well to baking and cooking. \nA farm product may be registered as \"Traditional Specialties Guaranteed\" (TSG) by the EU only if it is produced using traditional raw materials and prepared with traditional methods. \nTSG designation boosts farmer revenues as it increases the market value of the products registered, the Commission said. \nUK Apples & Pears Ltd, which represents three quarters of British producers, applied for TSG recognition in March, arguing that other pie fillings may contain a mix of apple varieties and artificial preservatives.

The views expressed are his own)\nBy John Kemp\nLONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are more bearish about the outlook for U.S. oil prices than at any time for almost five years, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nHedge funds and other money managers had a net long position in WTI-linked futures and options equivalent to just 118 million barrels of oil on July 21, down from a recent high of 294 million barrels 11 weeks earlier ( link.reuters.com/pug35w ).\nThe net position was the smallest since September 2010. Money managers interested in oil have a long bias (there has been no net short since the current time series began in 2006).

On the short side of the market, money managers have added almost 70 million barrels to take their total to almost 163 million barrels.\nThe ratio of long to short positions, at just 1.7 to 1, is the lowest since September 2010, and has fallen from more than 4 to 1 over the last 11 weeks ( link.reuters.com/naw25w ).\nThe question is how much further oil prices will fall, with hedge funds already so heavily invested in a bullish narrative?\nThere is scope for hedge funds to cut their net long position even further. Gross long positions were still almost 65 million barrels above their five-year low on July 21 while gross short positions were 47 million barrels below their five-year high.\nIt is likely that the net long position has already fallen further, since the data refer to positions at the end of trading on July 21, and oil prices continued to fall throughout the rest of the week.\nThe critical question is at what point the hedge funds start to square up their short positions in order to take their profits.

Adjusted profits of $3.8bn from the Anglo-Dutch giant beat the consensus estimate of $3.4bn soundly and the oil major also kept its dividend steady at $0.47 for ordinary shares and $0.94 per American depositary share. \nShell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) wants to further reduce 2015 capital investment to $30bn, 20% below where it stood a year ago due to its dim view of the oil price environment. Operating costs are expected to fall by $4bn, or around 10 per cent, in 2015 as part of chief executive Ben van Beurden's efficiency drive, with further reductions in operating costs expected next year. \nShell said it expects $30bn of asset sales between 2016 and 2018, on top of a total of $20bn in disposals for 2014 and 2015 combined. \n\"We have to be resilient in a world where oil prices remain low for some time, whilst keeping an eye on recovery,\" van Beurden said. \n\"We're taking a prudent approach, pulling on powerful financial levers to manage through this downturn, always making sure we have the capacity to pay attractive dividends for shareholders.\" Van Beurden also gave a progress report on the proposed merger with BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) . \n\"At the same time, we are making good progress with the recommended combination with BG, which should enhance our free cash flow, create an IOC leader in LNG and deep water innovation, and be a springboard to change Shell into a simpler and more profitable company.

During this past quarter, however, oil prices and the dollar have been fairly stable, meaning analysts&apos; earnings per share estimates (EPS) may have hit bottom and it&apos;s more likely that earnings come in above analysts&apos; estimates, at least according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nIn new research from Savita Subramanian, BofAML strategist, the worst of the cuts to earnings estimates is likely behind us.\nIn her note, she says that estimates for the second quarter have fallen by just two percent since April, or just half the amount she typically sees. Here are two charts highlighting her points:\nThe first one shows that the aggregate EPS estimate for all the companies in the S&P 500 seems to have stabilized since late April.\nThe second chart underscores the trend in earnings estimates in the three months leading up to earnings season. As you can see, there is a huge difference in the revisions for the first quarter of this year and the second quarter.\nSo, with that in mind, which sectors should you own? Here are Subramanian&apos;s recommendations:\nEach quarter we have ranked sectors by these measures, and for 2Q15 earnings season we found that that healthcare screens as most attractive, while materials screens as least attractive.\nHealthcare has now screened as the most attractive sector the last three quarters, and has continued to surprise to the upside.",

        "text_full": "Bank of America: Here's What you Should Own This Earnings Season\nIn case you forgot amidst the crisis in Greece and the rollercoaster ride that is Chinese stocks , earnings season is about to begin in the U.S.\nLast quarter the big stories were earnings declines in the energy sector thanks to falling oil prices and large international companies facing forex headwinds as the U.S. dollar strengthened against other currencies. During this past quarter, however, oil prices and the dollar have been fairly stable, meaning analysts&apos; earnings per share estimates (EPS) may have hit bottom and it&apos;s more likely that earnings come in above analysts&apos; estimates, at least according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nIn new research from Savita Subramanian, BofAML strategist, the worst of the cuts to earnings estimates is likely behind us.\nIn her note, she says that estimates for the second quarter have fallen by just two percent since April, or just half the amount she typically sees. Here are two charts highlighting her points:\nThe first one shows that the aggregate EPS estimate for all the companies in the S&P 500 seems to have stabilized since late April.\nThe second chart underscores the trend in earnings estimates in the three months leading up to earnings season. As you can see, there is a huge difference in the revisions for the first quarter of this year and the second quarter.\nSo, with that in mind, which sectors should you own? Here are Subramanian&apos;s recommendations:\nEach quarter we have ranked sectors by these measures, and for 2Q15 earnings season we found that that healthcare screens as most attractive, while materials screens as least attractive.\nHealthcare has now screened as the most attractive sector the last three quarters, and has continued to surprise to the upside.",

Traders are boosting bets on an easing in both countries.\n“We pay particular attention to Bank of Canada action given the commodity synergies of both countries,” said Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy. “We have been highlighting an increasing number of parallels to January.”\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia is “unlikely to be content” with the current level of the local currency with iron ore in a bear market, she said. Add to that China’s stocks turmoil and traders are pricing in a 40 percent chance of an RBA rate cut in September, up from 30 percent a week earlier. The odds climb to 63 percent by year’s end.\nWhile acknowledging the hurdle is high for Australia to ease from a record-low 2 percent, Ong sees reductions late this year and in mid 2016, bringing the cash rate to 1.5 percent.\n“Developments in China and Greece underscore some of our key drivers around the weaker terms of trade and incomes and support further easing,” she said. “The Bank of Canada developments are notable in that regard, support our base case scenario, and increase the risk of another cut occurring sooner.”",

Traders are boosting bets on an easing in both countries.\n“We pay particular attention to Bank of Canada action given the commodity synergies of both countries,” said Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy. “We have been highlighting an increasing number of parallels to January.”\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia is “unlikely to be content” with the current level of the local currency with iron ore in a bear market, she said. Add to that China’s stocks turmoil and traders are pricing in a 40 percent chance of an RBA rate cut in September, up from 30 percent a week earlier. The odds climb to 63 percent by year’s end.\nWhile acknowledging the hurdle is high for Australia to ease from a record-low 2 percent, Ong sees reductions late this year and in mid 2016, bringing the cash rate to 1.5 percent.\n“Developments in China and Greece underscore some of our key drivers around the weaker terms of trade and incomes and support further easing,” she said. “The Bank of Canada developments are notable in that regard, support our base case scenario, and increase the risk of another cut occurring sooner.”",

The government also downgraded its reading on April and May job growth. \nWhile the downbeat report gave investors little to cheer about, it was not gloomy enough to compel them to tweak their expectations for the timing of the Fed's tightening. \n\"We do not think that the report will significantly shift opinion within the Fed about timing of the first rate hike, which we continue to expect in September,\" strategists at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) wrote in a note. \nCaution also reigned ahead of Greece's Sunday referendum on an international bailout deal that could ultimately determine whether it stays or not in the euro zone. \nThe International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday that Greece would need an extension of its European Union loans and a potentially a large debt writeoff if it cannot implement economic reforms and its growth slows. \n\"Investors will probably look to JPY as a risk-hedge going into the referendum,\" Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at Citi, said in a note to clients.

The pound, meanwhile, strengthened after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, signaled that a U.K. interest-rate increase may come sooner than investors anticipate.\nCanada’s dollar, known as the loonie, tumbled to its lowest since March 2009 against the greenback after the nation’s central bank cut interest rates. Commodity producers are struggling as global demand for resources slows.\nThe New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, declined to a six-year low as a milk auction showed lower prices for dairy products, a key export.\nThe kiwi is also at its its weakest since January 2014 versus the euro.\nAustralia’s currency slid to its lowest since May 2009 on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, Mexico&apos;s peso approached an all-time low versus the dollar. The currency is less than 1 percent off its weakest level.",

The pound, meanwhile, strengthened after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, signaled that a U.K. interest-rate increase may come sooner than investors anticipate.\nCanada’s dollar, known as the loonie, tumbled to its lowest since March 2009 against the greenback after the nation’s central bank cut interest rates. Commodity producers are struggling as global demand for resources slows.\nThe New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, declined to a six-year low as a milk auction showed lower prices for dairy products, a key export.\nThe kiwi is also at its its weakest since January 2014 versus the euro.\nAustralia’s currency slid to its lowest since May 2009 on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, Mexico&apos;s peso approached an all-time low versus the dollar. The currency is less than 1 percent off its weakest level.",

Inflation is a little low” but will probably return to target.\nBullard said he doesn’t see Greece’s turmoil or China’s slowdown threatening the U.S. outlook.\n“Of course there are risks that are out there but I don’t think they’re going to manifest themselves in actually coming back to bite the U.S. economy during the second half of the year or beyond that,” he said.",

No financial details are given. At market price, the additional stake has a value of about 380 million pounds ($593 million). Liberty Global said it has no plans to make a full takeover offer.\n“This investment remains an opportunistic one for us in our largest market,” Liberty Global Chief Executive Officer Mike Fries said in the statement.\nLiberty Global said it had entered into a hedging transaction at the same time over the ITV shares and obtained further financing from its hedge counterparty. The deal would “result in net cash being released to Liberty Global,” it said.",

No financial details are given. At market price, the additional stake has a value of about 380 million pounds ($593 million). Liberty Global said it has no plans to make a full takeover offer.\n“This investment remains an opportunistic one for us in our largest market,” Liberty Global Chief Executive Officer Mike Fries said in the statement.\nLiberty Global said it had entered into a hedging transaction at the same time over the ITV shares and obtained further financing from its hedge counterparty. The deal would “result in net cash being released to Liberty Global,” it said.",

A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a fall of 5,000.\nThe jobless rate remained at 6.4 percent for the fourth straight month. That is the lowest since German reunification in 1990.\n\"Despite the small increase in non-seasonally adjusted terms, this labour market report is impressive,\" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.\n\"The German labour market has become solid as a rock and looks almost fully immune against any short-term volatility.\"\nGerman households remain upbeat. Morale among German consumers steadied going into August, with higher income expectations offset by concerns that a deal to keep Greece in the euro zone will weigh on Germany's economy.\nIn another positive sign from the German economy, business confidence improved in July as the agreement between Greece and its creditors for talks on a third bailout lifted the mood at firms in Europe's largest economy.\nReflecting the upbeat corporate mood, German trains-to-turbines group Siemens beat expectations for its third-quarter results and stuck to its full-year outlook on Thursday despite weakness in China.\nGerman economic growth weakened to 0.3 percent at the start of this year and the finance ministry said last week that the economy would probably expand by around the same amount between April and June, with domestic demand propelling growth while foreign trade picks up.

The equity value of the deal is about $1.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nHorizon in March began trying to contact Depomed’s management and board, which “refused to engage in discussions with us and rejected our proposal,” Horizon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Timothy Walbert said in the statement. “The strategic and financial benefits of our proposal are highly compelling,” he said.\nHorizon’s work on specialty treatments and primary care would complement Depomed’s products for pain and central nervous system disorders, Horizon said.\nA deal would add “immediately and substantially” to earnings, Horizon said. Depomed shareholders would own about 25 percent of the combined company if the deal occurs, according to Horizon, which would retire $575 million of senior secured notes with cash and new debt.\nThe combined company would have 13 marketed medicines, nearly doubling Horizon’s current portfolio, it said.\nCitigroup Inc. and Jefferies LLC are serving as lead financial advisers to Horizon.",

The equity value of the deal is about $1.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nHorizon in March began trying to contact Depomed’s management and board, which “refused to engage in discussions with us and rejected our proposal,” Horizon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Timothy Walbert said in the statement. “The strategic and financial benefits of our proposal are highly compelling,” he said.\nHorizon’s work on specialty treatments and primary care would complement Depomed’s products for pain and central nervous system disorders, Horizon said.\nA deal would add “immediately and substantially” to earnings, Horizon said. Depomed shareholders would own about 25 percent of the combined company if the deal occurs, according to Horizon, which would retire $575 million of senior secured notes with cash and new debt.\nThe combined company would have 13 marketed medicines, nearly doubling Horizon’s current portfolio, it said.\nCitigroup Inc. and Jefferies LLC are serving as lead financial advisers to Horizon.",

The company has 7,000 employees and operates 4,000 buses in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. \nScania is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of trucks and buses for heavy transport applications, and of industrial and marine engines. Service-related products account for a growing proportion of the company’s operations, assuring Scania customers of cost-effective transport solutions and maximum uptime. Scania also offers financial services. Employing some 42,000 people, the company operates in about 100 countries. Research and development activities are concentrated in Sweden, while production takes place in Europe and South America, with facilities for global interchange of both components and complete vehicles. In 2014, net sales totalled SEK 92.1 billion and net income amounted to SEK 6 billion.

Current rules allow companies to exclude names of investors’ director candidates from ballots cast in advance of annual meetings.\nThe chamber’s new group will be overseen by Tom Quaadman, vice president of its center for capital markets competitiveness, said spokeswoman Erica Flint. The group has 13 members, including the American Bankers Association, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the National Association of Manufacturers.\nIf the chamber’s coalition wants to “facilitate long-term value creation, they should support reforms that strengthen shareholder rights and oppose arrangements that insulate managements from shareholders,” said Lucian Bebchuk, a professor at Harvard Law School.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON, July 30 Fourteen U.S. lawmakers on Thursday told the Air Force and NASA they had \"serious concerns\" about the fact that SpaceX is leading an investigation into the June 28 explosion of its Falcon 9 rocket, and whether it would receive enough oversight.\nRepublican Representatives Mike Coffman from Colorado and Randy Forbes from Virginia led the bipartisan group, which questioned the two government agencies about what the explosion means for future NASA and Air Force launches.\nThe accident has raised questions about the government's increasing reliance on commercial launch providers and contracts, its oversight of accident investigations and whether such probes are as thorough as military investigations.\nAn Orbital ATK Inc rocket explosion in October claimed a Cygnus cargo ship that, like the Falcon 9, was bound for the International Space Station. Orbital is expected to send the Federal Aviation Administration a long-awaited accident report next week.\nIn a letter dated Thursday, the lawmakers questioned the government's decision to allow SpaceX to investigate its own accident, subject to oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration, instead of having a government agency lead it.\nSpaceX and Orbital are investigating their own mishaps, subject to FAA oversight, since the launches were conducted under an FAA license, rather than under government oversight.\n\"We have serious reservations about this approach and are concerned whether the investigation and engineering rigor applied will be sufficient to prevent future military launch mishaps,\" the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Air Force Secretary Deborah James and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.\nThey asked the officials to explain what requirements and reviews SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies, must meet to return the Falcon 9 rocket to flight, and to map out their own roles and oversight in the process.\nSpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk last week said a faulty metal brace likely triggered the explosion that destroyed the booster minutes after liftoff from Florida, destroying a load of cargo destined for the space station.\nHe said SpaceX is looking for other issues that may have caused or contributed to the accident, and that the company had possibly become \"a little bit complacent.\"\nThe lawmakers also asked Bolden and James whether any changes to the Falcon 9 design to fix the anomaly would require a new certification and licensing process.

        "text_full": "US lawmakers question NASA, Air Force on blast probe led by SpaceX\nWASHINGTON, July 30 Fourteen U.S. lawmakers on Thursday told the Air Force and NASA they had \"serious concerns\" about the fact that SpaceX is leading an investigation into the June 28 explosion of its Falcon 9 rocket, and whether it would receive enough oversight.\nRepublican Representatives Mike Coffman from Colorado and Randy Forbes from Virginia led the bipartisan group, which questioned the two government agencies about what the explosion means for future NASA and Air Force launches.\nThe accident has raised questions about the government's increasing reliance on commercial launch providers and contracts, its oversight of accident investigations and whether such probes are as thorough as military investigations.\nAn Orbital ATK Inc rocket explosion in October claimed a Cygnus cargo ship that, like the Falcon 9, was bound for the International Space Station. Orbital is expected to send the Federal Aviation Administration a long-awaited accident report next week.\nIn a letter dated Thursday, the lawmakers questioned the government's decision to allow SpaceX to investigate its own accident, subject to oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration, instead of having a government agency lead it.\nSpaceX and Orbital are investigating their own mishaps, subject to FAA oversight, since the launches were conducted under an FAA license, rather than under government oversight.\n\"We have serious reservations about this approach and are concerned whether the investigation and engineering rigor applied will be sufficient to prevent future military launch mishaps,\" the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Air Force Secretary Deborah James and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.\nThey asked the officials to explain what requirements and reviews SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies, must meet to return the Falcon 9 rocket to flight, and to map out their own roles and oversight in the process.\nSpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk last week said a faulty metal brace likely triggered the explosion that destroyed the booster minutes after liftoff from Florida, destroying a load of cargo destined for the space station.\nHe said SpaceX is looking for other issues that may have caused or contributed to the accident, and that the company had possibly become \"a little bit complacent.\"\nThe lawmakers also asked Bolden and James whether any changes to the Falcon 9 design to fix the anomaly would require a new certification and licensing process.

Demand is the highest since 2007 as Americans drove the most miles ever over the first five months of 2015. The price at the pump is 24 percent less than a year ago, thanks to a global oil rout. \n“We certainly expected some price demand elasticity for gasoline,” Gary Simmons, senior vice president for Valero Energy Corp., said on a conference call today. “As long as we see the lower prices I think we expect the demand response to continue to be good.” \nValero, the second-biggest U.S. independent refiner, said it’s maximizing gasoline production as it posted its best quarterly results since 2007. The fuel is averaging almost 23 cents over diesel this quarter, the most in 8 years. \nThe pivot to gasoline comes as the shale boom has brought a flood of light crude that yields more gasoline components, and after the company spent $3 billion building two hydrocrackers in 2013 to boost diesel production. \nValero’s $2.66-a-share profit beat a $2.42 average of 18 analyst estimates. The refiner’s gasoline yield was over 48 percent in the quarter. Two other refiners that announced earnings today, PBF Energy Inc. and Marathon Petroleum Corp., both missed estimates. They turn about 45 percent of each barrel of crude into gasoline. \n“Every time we try to predict the future and what’s going to happen, events overtake us,” PBF Chairman Tom O’Malley said on a conference call. “We have much less expensive gasoline here in the U.S. as a result of these low crude oil prices. That’s going to continue to add to the importance of gasoline, which had somehow faded a little bit, and I think to maintain refining margins.”",

That compared with $379 million for the larger 747-8, which has struggled to attract orders.\nBoeing said the price increases reflect higher wages as well as rising costs for materials, parts and services. The 2.9 percent increase from 2014 prices compares with a 3.1 percent increase last year from 2013 and a 1.6 percent increase in 2013.\nBy comparison, rival plane maker Airbus lifted its list prices by 3.3 percent in January. The cheapest Airbus plane, the single-aisle A318, now lists for $6.3 million less than the least expensive Boeing plane, the 737-700, which lists for $80.6 million. At the top end, the largest Airbus plane, the A380, lists for $428 million.\nAirlines typically receive steep discounts from list prices, but the figures are used for valuing orders.\nPrice increases are an annual exercise, and Boeing said the timing of the latest increase was not related to Dennis Muilenburg taking on the role of chief executive on Wednesday.

Everything else in its own time,\" he said. (Reporting by James Mackenzie ; editing by Costas Pitas )",

The Council itself could not immediately be reached for comment. \nThe court at the same time declined to remove two other companies, Petropars Iran Co and Petropars Oilfields Services Co, from the list because of the larger stakes those entities have in parent group NIOC. \nWhile the decision to remove the two groups was not related to the recent nuclear agreement, a lawyer for the two said she was hopeful the warming relations between Iran and the west would ensure her clients stay off the list of sanctioned companies. \n\"Because this is the first annulment that happened after the Iran agreement ... we are hoping that the council has not appealed in good faith,\" said Pavani Reddy, managing partner of law firm Zaiwalla and Co Solicitors, adding that applying new charges against them would be \"a waste of time and resources\". \nEuropean courts in the past nullified sanctions against the National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC), Iran's biggest tanker firm, only to put it back on the list later.

After trilateral talks including the European Commission broke down, European Parliament President Martin Schulz told Ukraine's parliament that Russia should quickly return to negotiations with Ukraine to hammer out a long-term gas deal, according to Russian newswires. \nGazprom cut off gas delivery to Ukraine's Naftogaz on 1 July after Kiev's attempts to receive a larger gas discount from Moscow proved a spanner in the negotiation works. \nThe Russian state gas giant, which said the valves had been shut off as Ukraine had not paid in advance for July's gas supplies, refused to budge from offering the same discount to Ukraine as was in place for the second quarter of 2015. \nRussia has offered to keep the price it charges Ukraine through the end of September at $247 per thousand cubic metres of gas, which represents a $40 discount from the maximum price under the terms of a prior agreement. \nHowever, Kiev, which has begun to increasingly rely on supplies from European countries such as Norway, has demanded at least a 30% discount for the third quarter. \nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said earlier that Ukraine should pay the same price for gas as its neighbours do. \nGazprom has previously insisted that the gas pricing formula for Ukraine will not be changed until late 2019, with gas supplies only made after prepayment, irrespective of the price. \nUkrainian gas pipeline operator Ukrtransgaz recently said over the past six months Ukraine has imported 6.3bn cubic metres of gas from Europe and 3.7bn cubic metres of gas from Russia.",

Learn more... \nFri, Jul 3, 2015, 15:25 BST - UK Markets close in 1 hr 5 mins EU urges Russia and Ukraine to return to gas negotiating table Sharecast – 20 minutes ago Print \nLONDON (ShareCast) - The European Union has urged Ukraine and Russia to make concessions to reach a deal after long-term gas talks broke down this week. After trilateral talks including the European Commission broke down, European Parliament President Martin Schulz told Ukraine's parliament that Russia should quickly return to negotiations with Ukraine to hammer out a long-term gas deal, according to Russian newswires. \nGazprom cut off gas delivery to Ukraine's Naftogaz on 1 July after Kiev's attempts to receive a larger gas discount from Moscow proved a spanner in the negotiation works. \nThe Russian state gas giant, which said the valves had been shut off as Ukraine had not paid in advance for July's gas supplies, refused to budge from offering the same discount to Ukraine as was in place for the second quarter of 2015. \nRussia has offered to keep the price it charges Ukraine through the end of September at $247 per thousand cubic metres of gas, which represents a $40 discount from the maximum price under the terms of a prior agreement. \nHowever, Kiev, which has begun to increasingly rely on supplies from European countries such as Norway, has demanded at least a 30% discount for the third quarter. \nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said earlier that Ukraine should pay the same price for gas as its neighbours do. \nGazprom has previously insisted that the gas pricing formula for Ukraine will not be changed until late 2019, with gas supplies only made after prepayment, irrespective of the price. \nUkrainian gas pipeline operator Ukrtransgaz recently said over the past six months Ukraine has imported 6.3bn cubic metres of gas from Europe and 3.7bn cubic metres of gas from Russia.",
