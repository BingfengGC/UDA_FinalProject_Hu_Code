        "text": "NEW YORK Aug 10 Shares of brokerage firm RCS Capital Corp fell 30 percent to an all-time low Monday, exacerbating a 35 percent decline over the previous two trading days after it announced a shakeup of its business and management.\nRCS, which owns 11 brokerage firms with more than 9,000 independent brokers, said on Thursday it will divest a major business, give 5.6 million shares to senior executives and a major outside investor and replace its chief executive and chief financial officer. It also announced a loss of $66.1 million in the second quarter and gave a gloomy outlook for the rest of 2015.\nRCS sells investment products and advice to individual investors through its Cetera Financial Group brokerage unit. The company was put together in the past two years by real estate entrepreneur Nicholas Schorsch. His business empire began to face problems in 2014 after his company American Realty Capital Properties, now known as Vereit, reported a $23 million accounting error.\nCitigroup brokerage firm analyst William Katz on Monday downgraded RCS stock to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" citing liquidity concerns and the company's need for additional capital. RCS says it has arranged a solid round of recapitalization and renegotiated its loan conditions.\nRCS is selling its \"wholesale\" business, which supplies other retail brokerage firms with \"alternative\" investments, for $25 million to private equity firm Apollo Global Management . An RCS investor, seeking anonymity to comply with his brokerage firm employer's policies, said he scratched his head at the low sales price, thinking the company meant to write $250 million.\nMany brokerage firms suspended their contracts to sell RCS's wholesale products after the Schorsch-related accounting issue.\nRCS stock was down 30 percent to $2.80 in the early afternoon, passing its previous low of $2.92. It first issued shares to the public in June 2013 at $20.\n\"We see three key issues for the stock in the intermediate term, even at these levels,\" Katz wrote in his note to investors, \"liquidity; debt covenant coverage and potentially the need to raise equity.\" Citigroup lowered its price target on the shares to $4 from $18.

It also announced a loss of $66.1 million in the second quarter and gave a gloomy outlook for the rest of 2015.\nRCS sells investment products and advice to individual investors through its Cetera Financial Group brokerage unit. The company was put together in the past two years by real estate entrepreneur Nicholas Schorsch. His business empire began to face problems in 2014 after his company American Realty Capital Properties, now known as Vereit, reported a $23 million accounting error.\nCitigroup brokerage firm analyst William Katz on Monday downgraded RCS stock to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" citing liquidity concerns and the company's need for additional capital. RCS says it has arranged a solid round of recapitalization and renegotiated its loan conditions.\nRCS is selling its \"wholesale\" business, which supplies other retail brokerage firms with \"alternative\" investments, for $25 million to private equity firm Apollo Global Management . An RCS investor, seeking anonymity to comply with his brokerage firm employer's policies, said he scratched his head at the low sales price, thinking the company meant to write $250 million.\nMany brokerage firms suspended their contracts to sell RCS's wholesale products after the Schorsch-related accounting issue.\nRCS stock was down 30 percent to $2.80 in the early afternoon, passing its previous low of $2.92. It first issued shares to the public in June 2013 at $20.\n\"We see three key issues for the stock in the intermediate term, even at these levels,\" Katz wrote in his note to investors, \"liquidity; debt covenant coverage and potentially the need to raise equity.\" Citigroup lowered its price target on the shares to $4 from $18.

For the six months to the end of June, the group's net asset value total return was 5.5%, ahead of the 3.6% delivered by its benchmark, which is a composite of four indices - the FTSE All-Share Index 40%, the FTSE All-World North America Index 20%, the FTSE All-World Europe and the FTSE All-World Asia Pacific Index 20%. \nGroup chairman Harry Henderson and group chief executive Andrew Bell cited sustained growth in the US and UK markets and improving conditions in other regions as the main reason for its performances in the first six months of the year. \n\"The US and UK economies are growing at rates that have brought forward expectations that current near-zero interest rates will soon start to rise, although the authorities have been careful to reassure that the pace of tightening will be gradual,\" they said in a joint statement. \nHowever, they both warn of the risk posed by some emerging economies. \n\"China's economy has been slowing for some years, amid concerns that a period of excessive property and infrastructure investment had left its banks exposed to bad debts,\" they said. \n\"This year has also seen the puffing up and bursting of a domestic stock market bubble, which risks undermining confidence in China's nascent financial markets.\" Despite the difficulties experienced in certain areas, however, Henderson insisted there seemed to be more \"economic tailwinds than headwinds\". \n\"Corporate earnings are improving, the effect of low oil prices should support consumer demand in oil-importing countries and liquidity trends remain positive,\" he said. \nWitan shares were down 0.59% to 799.22p at 0832 BST on Tuesday.",

For the six months to the end of June, the group's net asset value total return was 5.5%, ahead of the 3.6% delivered by its benchmark, which is a composite of four indices - the FTSE All-Share Index 40%, the FTSE All-World North America Index 20%, the FTSE All-World Europe and the FTSE All-World Asia Pacific Index 20%. \nGroup chairman Harry Henderson and group chief executive Andrew Bell cited sustained growth in the US and UK markets and improving conditions in other regions as the main reason for its performances in the first six months of the year. \n\"The US and UK economies are growing at rates that have brought forward expectations that current near-zero interest rates will soon start to rise, although the authorities have been careful to reassure that the pace of tightening will be gradual,\" they said in a joint statement. \nHowever, they both warn of the risk posed by some emerging economies. \n\"China's economy has been slowing for some years, amid concerns that a period of excessive property and infrastructure investment had left its banks exposed to bad debts,\" they said. \n\"This year has also seen the puffing up and bursting of a domestic stock market bubble, which risks undermining confidence in China's nascent financial markets.\" Despite the difficulties experienced in certain areas, however, Henderson insisted there seemed to be more \"economic tailwinds than headwinds\". \n\"Corporate earnings are improving, the effect of low oil prices should support consumer demand in oil-importing countries and liquidity trends remain positive,\" he said. \nWitan shares were down 0.59% to 799.22p at 0832 BST on Tuesday.",

        "text": "Aug 7 Eli Lilly on Friday was cleared of liability in the first trial involving claims that its antidepressant Cymbalta caused severe withdrawal symptoms, including suicidal thoughts and electric shock-like sensations, the company said.\nEli Lily has been sued by roughly 250 plaintiffs who say that the company downplayed warnings about symptoms that can occur when patients quit the popular drug, which has annual sales of about $3.9 billion. The trial this week on the lawsuit filed by Claudia Herrera in federal court in California is the first of four trials over Cymbalta withdrawal scheduled for this month. The trial started on Tuesday, and the jury returned its verdict on Friday.\n\"While Lilly is sympathetic to Ms. Herrera's conditions, we are pleased with the jury's verdict,\" Lilly spokeswoman Celeste Stanley said.\nLawyers for Herrera did not immediately return requests for comment.\nCymbalta, part of a class of antidepressants known as serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004 to treat major depressive disorder. Later, approval was expanded to include generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia.\nIts label warns that 1 percent or more of users who discontinue Cymbalta may experience symptoms like nausea, irritability and insomnia, and that other symptoms such as sensory disturbances and seizures have been reported.\nPlaintiffs suing Lilly allege that withdrawal symptoms are far more common, pointing to a 2005 analysis from the Journal of Affective Disorders that found more than 44 percent of patients reported at least one discontinuation symptom.\nAccording to Herrera's lawsuit, she started taking Cymbalta in 2006 for anxiety. When her doctor instructed her in 2012 to ease off gradually, she said that she suffered electric-like \"zaps,\" anxiety, spasms and suicidal ideation, among other symptoms.\nHerrera accused Lilly of downplaying its warnings to make the drug more marketable. Lilly said in court filings that it gave sufficient warnings and that Herrera's doctor was aware of the potential risks.\nA similar case is set for trial in California starting on Tuesday.

        "text_full": "U.S. jury clears Eli Lilly in first Cymbalta withdrawal trial\nAug 7 Eli Lilly on Friday was cleared of liability in the first trial involving claims that its antidepressant Cymbalta caused severe withdrawal symptoms, including suicidal thoughts and electric shock-like sensations, the company said.\nEli Lily has been sued by roughly 250 plaintiffs who say that the company downplayed warnings about symptoms that can occur when patients quit the popular drug, which has annual sales of about $3.9 billion. The trial this week on the lawsuit filed by Claudia Herrera in federal court in California is the first of four trials over Cymbalta withdrawal scheduled for this month. The trial started on Tuesday, and the jury returned its verdict on Friday.\n\"While Lilly is sympathetic to Ms. Herrera's conditions, we are pleased with the jury's verdict,\" Lilly spokeswoman Celeste Stanley said.\nLawyers for Herrera did not immediately return requests for comment.\nCymbalta, part of a class of antidepressants known as serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004 to treat major depressive disorder. Later, approval was expanded to include generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia.\nIts label warns that 1 percent or more of users who discontinue Cymbalta may experience symptoms like nausea, irritability and insomnia, and that other symptoms such as sensory disturbances and seizures have been reported.\nPlaintiffs suing Lilly allege that withdrawal symptoms are far more common, pointing to a 2005 analysis from the Journal of Affective Disorders that found more than 44 percent of patients reported at least one discontinuation symptom.\nAccording to Herrera's lawsuit, she started taking Cymbalta in 2006 for anxiety. When her doctor instructed her in 2012 to ease off gradually, she said that she suffered electric-like \"zaps,\" anxiety, spasms and suicidal ideation, among other symptoms.\nHerrera accused Lilly of downplaying its warnings to make the drug more marketable. Lilly said in court filings that it gave sufficient warnings and that Herrera's doctor was aware of the potential risks.\nA similar case is set for trial in California starting on Tuesday.

Telegraph – 1 hour 33 minutes ago -3.00 \nOur consumer expert helps a retiree after the taxman suddenly starts making deductions \nI am so frustrated that I cannot get a response from HMRC over my tax. I have written three letters and tried to phone several times. I am 85 and my income from three small annuities plus state pension is only £10,082. Since my tax allowance is £10,800 I am not a taxpayer and have not been for many years. \nSuddenly this year HMRC has told two of my annuity providers to deduct tax. My other annuity is not having tax deducted. RM (LSE: RM.L - news ) , Hants \nYou tried to no avail to sort out your problem on your own. I spoke to HMRC and a helpful member of staff quickly called and arranged for the tax issue to be corrected. \nMH of Rutland also wrote in, this time about difficulties concerning a change in circumstances which affected her tax code. Her employer had failed to update information about a company car so that MH’s coding factored in expense payments the employer was allegedly making to MH to use her own car when in fact none were now being made. \nI suggested that MH give the taxman more time to verify the facts. HMRC then issued her with a new tax code and a refund of nearly £400, along with details about how this was calculated. \n• '£500 bill was HMRC's mistake' \n• 'Is this email from HMRC or is it a scam?' \nUseful information may be found via gov.uk under “tax codes”. HMRC’s number is 0300 200 3300. \nTax Help for Older People helps over‑60s with incomes of less than £20,000 a year.

Telegraph – 1 hour 33 minutes ago -3.00 \nOur consumer expert helps a retiree after the taxman suddenly starts making deductions \nI am so frustrated that I cannot get a response from HMRC over my tax. I have written three letters and tried to phone several times. I am 85 and my income from three small annuities plus state pension is only £10,082. Since my tax allowance is £10,800 I am not a taxpayer and have not been for many years. \nSuddenly this year HMRC has told two of my annuity providers to deduct tax. My other annuity is not having tax deducted. RM (LSE: RM.L - news ) , Hants \nYou tried to no avail to sort out your problem on your own. I spoke to HMRC and a helpful member of staff quickly called and arranged for the tax issue to be corrected. \nMH of Rutland also wrote in, this time about difficulties concerning a change in circumstances which affected her tax code. Her employer had failed to update information about a company car so that MH’s coding factored in expense payments the employer was allegedly making to MH to use her own car when in fact none were now being made. \nI suggested that MH give the taxman more time to verify the facts. HMRC then issued her with a new tax code and a refund of nearly £400, along with details about how this was calculated. \n• '£500 bill was HMRC's mistake' \n• 'Is this email from HMRC or is it a scam?' \nUseful information may be found via gov.uk under “tax codes”. HMRC’s number is 0300 200 3300. \nTax Help for Older People helps over‑60s with incomes of less than £20,000 a year. Call 01308 488066 or visit taxvol.org.uk . \nTaxAid is another charity for under-60s and the self-employed with the same income limit.

It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) currently accounts for around 80pc of all British bicycle exports. \nChief executive Will Butler-Adams said that remaining in London \"comes with risks but these are worth taking if wish to continue to innovate.\" \nThe folding bicycle was first designed and built by Andrew Ritchie in 1975 in his flat in South Kensington, opposite the Brompton Oratory. \nThe classic Brompton sells for around £1,000. But jazzier, flashier models have been introduced more recently and the company is also increasingly targeting export markets, especially in Asia. \nBrompton has benefitted from cycling's growing popularity, particularly in commuter cities like London . \nBuilt on the recent success of British professional riders such as Sir Bradley Wiggins and Lizzie Armitstead, cycling is now big business in the UK and generates an estimated £2bn in annual retail sales (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

Learn more... \nMon, Aug 17, 2015, 17:02 BST - UK Markets closed Brompton Bicycle to move to bigger London factory By Andrew Critchlow | Telegraph – 32 minutes ago 0.0000 \nMaker of the folding commuter bike aims to double output to 100,000 bikes per year \nBrompton Bicycle plans to move to a bigger factory in West London in a drive to double output of the folding commuter bikes which carry its name. \nThe company said it will be moving to a new facility in Greenford, West London, which will be twice the size of its current factory in Brentford. \nBrompton hopes that the factory, which will be ready early next year, will allow it to double production to around 100,000 folding bikes per year. \nThe company is a rare example of a UK bicycle manufacturer that has succeeded in competing with brands produced in Asia. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) currently accounts for around 80pc of all British bicycle exports. \nChief executive Will Butler-Adams said that remaining in London \"comes with risks but these are worth taking if wish to continue to innovate.\" \nThe folding bicycle was first designed and built by Andrew Ritchie in 1975 in his flat in South Kensington, opposite the Brompton Oratory. \nThe classic Brompton sells for around £1,000. But jazzier, flashier models have been introduced more recently and the company is also increasingly targeting export markets, especially in Asia. \nBrompton has benefitted from cycling's growing popularity, particularly in commuter cities like London . \nBuilt on the recent success of British professional riders such as Sir Bradley Wiggins and Lizzie Armitstead, cycling is now big business in the UK and generates an estimated £2bn in annual retail sales (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

        "text": "ATLANTA Aug 14 A U.S. court hearing on the fate of 18 beluga whales captured in Russia is expected on Friday to pit federal regulators against the Georgia aquarium seeking to bring them to the United States.\nU.S. environmental officers have said that moving the whales to the United States would hasten the depletion of the wild beluga whale population and violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\nThe Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, which is suing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries service, says that its efforts will help the beluga whales.\nAlso known as white whales, belugas normally swim in Arctic or sub-Arctic waters and are classified as endangered in some areas and as \"near threatened\" worldwide, according to the Georgia Aquarium.\nAquarium lawyers told the U.S. district court in Atlanta that marine biologists will study the whales, and their public display will promote public education and conservation efforts.\nThe aquarium sued the government in September 2013 for the right to acquire the whales, which were captured in 2006 off the coast of northern Russia in the Sea of Okhotsk and are currently in the care of Russian scientists.\nThis will be the second time the case has appeared before U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg, who last August heard arguments when the aquarium sought access to internal government documents that led up to the denial of its permit.\nUp until March 2013, the project seemed to have been given the green light from NOAA, according to court documents filed by the aquarium. The judge has not yet issued a ruling.\nIf the aquarium, which already has three belugas, succeeds in bringing the whales to the United States, some would remain in Atlanta on display and the others would go to marine facilities across the country including SeaWorld parks and other aquariums, the permit application said.\nSeaWorld has come under scrutiny for its killer whale shows.\nScott Higley, a spokesperson for Georgia Aquarium said \"the decision will be based on what is best for the collective beluga population in accredited facilities in North America. They will only go to accredited facilities that already care for belugas.\"\nTwo baby beluga whales born at the aquarium have died since 2012, although their deaths have not been raised as an issue in the case.\nIf the permit is denied, the whales' fate would remain in the hands of Russia. No final court decision is expected for several months. (Editing by Letitia Stein and Sandra Maler )",

        "text_full": "Georgia court to weigh destiny of 18 captured beluga whales\nATLANTA Aug 14 A U.S. court hearing on the fate of 18 beluga whales captured in Russia is expected on Friday to pit federal regulators against the Georgia aquarium seeking to bring them to the United States.\nU.S. environmental officers have said that moving the whales to the United States would hasten the depletion of the wild beluga whale population and violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\nThe Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, which is suing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries service, says that its efforts will help the beluga whales.\nAlso known as white whales, belugas normally swim in Arctic or sub-Arctic waters and are classified as endangered in some areas and as \"near threatened\" worldwide, according to the Georgia Aquarium.\nAquarium lawyers told the U.S. district court in Atlanta that marine biologists will study the whales, and their public display will promote public education and conservation efforts.\nThe aquarium sued the government in September 2013 for the right to acquire the whales, which were captured in 2006 off the coast of northern Russia in the Sea of Okhotsk and are currently in the care of Russian scientists.\nThis will be the second time the case has appeared before U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg, who last August heard arguments when the aquarium sought access to internal government documents that led up to the denial of its permit.\nUp until March 2013, the project seemed to have been given the green light from NOAA, according to court documents filed by the aquarium. The judge has not yet issued a ruling.\nIf the aquarium, which already has three belugas, succeeds in bringing the whales to the United States, some would remain in Atlanta on display and the others would go to marine facilities across the country including SeaWorld parks and other aquariums, the permit application said.\nSeaWorld has come under scrutiny for its killer whale shows.\nScott Higley, a spokesperson for Georgia Aquarium said \"the decision will be based on what is best for the collective beluga population in accredited facilities in North America. They will only go to accredited facilities that already care for belugas.\"\nTwo baby beluga whales born at the aquarium have died since 2012, although their deaths have not been raised as an issue in the case.\nIf the permit is denied, the whales' fate would remain in the hands of Russia. No final court decision is expected for several months. (Editing by Letitia Stein and Sandra Maler )",

Mr Mullen admitted that Ladbrokes had lost ground to William Hill in sports-betting and plans to close the gap with a three-year investment programme. \nLast Thursday, shares in William Hill tumbled when the bookie posted a 35pc plunge in first-half pre-tax profits to £78.7m after it was hit by higher gambling taxes, new restrictions on gaming machines, and one-off charges at its Australian business. Ladbrokes will also have been affected by the heavier tax burden and tougher gaming machine rules during the half-year.",

China also devalued its currency, suggesting economic growth there was softer and could cause lower crude demand. \nBenchmark U.S. crude fell $1.88, or 4 percent, to $43.08 a barrel in New York. Its previous low for this year was $43.46 on March 17. \nU.S. crude has been declining since reaching a high this year of $61.43 a barrel on June 10. \nBrent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, declined $1.23, or 2.4 percent, to $49.18 a barrel in London.

Learn more... \nTue, Aug 11, 2015, 20:26 BST - UK Markets closed Oil price slumps to lowest level in more than 6 years Oil price slides to lowest level since 2009 amid demand worries, higher OPEC production By Alex Veiga, AP Business Writer | Associated Press – 4 minutes 36 seconds ago Print \nThe price of U.S. crude oil has tumbled to its lowest level in more than six years. \nThe latest slide on Tuesday came as OPEC said its production rose to a three-year high. China also devalued its currency, suggesting economic growth there was softer and could cause lower crude demand. \nBenchmark U.S. crude fell $1.88, or 4 percent, to $43.08 a barrel in New York. Its previous low for this year was $43.46 on March 17. \nU.S. crude has been declining since reaching a high this year of $61.43 a barrel on June 10. \nBrent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, declined $1.23, or 2.4 percent, to $49.18 a barrel in London.

        "text": "SAN DIEGO Aug 17 The death toll from a mid-air collision between an executive jet used by military contractor BAE Systems Inc and a small plane over Southern California on Sunday has risen to five, according to a fire department spokesman.\nThe fiery crash left debris and bodies scattered over more than a mile and sparked brush fires in the area where the wreckage landed near the U.S border with Mexico, San Diego-based Cal Fire Division Chief Nick Schuler said on Monday.\nA twin-engine Sabreliner crashed with a single-engine Cessna 172 around 11 a.m. local time on Sunday some two miles (3 km) from Brown Field Airport in San Diego County, Schuler said.\nFour of the dead were traveling on the Sabreliner, according to the San Diego County Medical Examiner. The fifth victim was the pilot of the Cessna, which had no known passengers, the examiner's office said.\nBAE Systems on Monday said the Sabreliner was registered to the British-based military contractor but declined to give any other details.\n\"While we are working with authorities to ascertain exactly what transpired, there are many details we do not know. As a result, we cannot confirm any names or other details at this time,\" it said in a statement.\nAccording to its website, the company has a shipyard in San Diego and has contracts with the U.S. Navy to train pilots.\nDebris from the collision littered a field west of the airport and caused a 2-acre (8,000-sq meter) brush fire that was put out by firefighters, Schuler said.\nNo one was injured on the ground, but a firefighter was taken to the hospital for heat exhaustion, he said.\n\"It appears it was a very violent crash, as you can tell by both aircraft being in multiple pieces,\" Schuler said.\nThe FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate what caused the crash, an FAA spokesman said.

The fifth victim was the pilot of the Cessna, which had no known passengers, the examiner's office said.\nBAE Systems on Monday said the Sabreliner was registered to the British-based military contractor but declined to give any other details.\n\"While we are working with authorities to ascertain exactly what transpired, there are many details we do not know. As a result, we cannot confirm any names or other details at this time,\" it said in a statement.\nAccording to its website, the company has a shipyard in San Diego and has contracts with the U.S. Navy to train pilots.\nDebris from the collision littered a field west of the airport and caused a 2-acre (8,000-sq meter) brush fire that was put out by firefighters, Schuler said.\nNo one was injured on the ground, but a firefighter was taken to the hospital for heat exhaustion, he said.\n\"It appears it was a very violent crash, as you can tell by both aircraft being in multiple pieces,\" Schuler said.\nThe FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate what caused the crash, an FAA spokesman said.

All died in the crash. \nIt was not immediately clear how the victims were related to the late al Qaeda leader, whose family is one of the most prominent business dynasties in Saudi Arabia. \n\"We do believe three of the deceased to be the mother, sister and brother-in-law of the owner of the aircraft, all of whom are from the bin Laden family, but formal post-mortem examinations are ongoing,\" Hampshire Police said in a statement. \nMedia reports said the victims included bin Laden's half-sister along with her husband and mother. Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television named those killed as Sana' Mohamed bin Laden, her husband Zuhair Hashem and Sana's mother, Raja' Hashem. \nThe plane's Jordanian pilot was the other person on board, al-Arabiya said. British police said the three passengers were travelling to Britain for a vacation. \nThe Saudi Ambassador to Britain on Friday offered condolences to the bin Laden family on the embassy's Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) account. He said the embassy was working with British authorities to investigate the incident and organise the speedy transfer of the bodies for burial in the kingdom. \nBritain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch said it was looking into the cause of the crash. \nOsama bin Laden, the accused mastermind of the 2001 attacks on the United States, was killed by U.S. special forces in a raid on his hideout in Pakistan in 2011.

        "text": "(Adds Moody's comments on notes, details on Carajas expansion)\nSAO PAULO Aug 5 (Reuters) - The board of Vale SA , the world's largest iron ore producer, on Wednesday approved plans to raise 1 billion reais ($287 million) from the sale of debt notes to expand the railway system at its Carajas ore mine.\nVale plans to file a request with the securities industry watchdog CVM on Thursday to approve the sale of the so-called infrastructure notes in two portions, according to a securities filing. The notes will have maturities of five and seven years and could be increased by 350 million reais pending certain conditions, the filing said.\nCredit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service rated the senior unsecured notes at Baa2, the second-lowest investment-grade ranking, with a \"negative\" outlook. Though Vale has a fairly diversified portfolio of mining assets in areas such as nickel and coal, most of its revenue comes from iron ore.\nMoody's said its negative outlook was based on the agency's expectations that iron ore prices \"will not experience any meaningful recovery before 2017\" due to the slowdown in China's economic growth and steel production.\nVale's railway investment is part of its expansion of production at its Carajas iron ore mine in Para state in the Amazon Basin.

The notes will have maturities of five and seven years and could be increased by 350 million reais pending certain conditions, the filing said.\nCredit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service rated the senior unsecured notes at Baa2, the second-lowest investment-grade ranking, with a \"negative\" outlook. Though Vale has a fairly diversified portfolio of mining assets in areas such as nickel and coal, most of its revenue comes from iron ore.\nMoody's said its negative outlook was based on the agency's expectations that iron ore prices \"will not experience any meaningful recovery before 2017\" due to the slowdown in China's economic growth and steel production.\nVale's railway investment is part of its expansion of production at its Carajas iron ore mine in Para state in the Amazon Basin.

        "text": "The dollar rose to a four-month high as a report showing continued growth in the U.S. labor market supported moves toward higher interest rates.\nThe U.S. currency climbed versus most major peers as the report showed another month of 200,000-plus jobs growth and the unemployment rate remained at a seven-year low.

        "text": "Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said that while the “time is coming” to raise interest rates, he’s waiting to see how economic data bear out before deciding whether to support such a move next month.\n“Fortunately, I don’t have to figure it out now,” Powell said Wednesday in a CNBC interview. “I’m going to be very, very focused on the data.”\nPowell said he’ll be especially attuned to employment data before the next meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, and that the labor market has been giving a better signal of economic growth than gross domestic product. Even so, there may be more slack in the labor market than the unemployment rate of 5.3 percent indicates, he said.\n“The time is coming. I think most members of the FOMC at the June meeting believed that it was time to raise interest rates sometime this year,” Powell said. “When we do that, there will be -- if the economy continues to grow -- there will be a process of raising rates, gradually, over time.”\nPowell’s comments come after two of his colleagues signaled a willingness to raise interest rates next month for the first time since 2006.\nDennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed and a voting member this year of the FOMC, told the Wall Street Journal in a story published Tuesday that it would take a significant deterioration in the data to convince him not to begin in September.\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard told the Journal last week that “we are in good shape” for a rate increase next month.\nThe economy expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter, in line with Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s view that a dismal reading early in the year was transitory. Still, inflation hasn’t exceeded the Fed’s target for three years.\nEmployment reports for July and August will be released before the next FOMC meeting, set for Sept. 16-17, and will be followed by a Yellen press conference. The July jobs report will be released Friday, and the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists projects an increase of 225,000 jobs.",

        "text_full": "Fed’s Powell Says Data to Guide His View on September Rate Rise\nFederal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said that while the “time is coming” to raise interest rates, he’s waiting to see how economic data bear out before deciding whether to support such a move next month.\n“Fortunately, I don’t have to figure it out now,” Powell said Wednesday in a CNBC interview. “I’m going to be very, very focused on the data.”\nPowell said he’ll be especially attuned to employment data before the next meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, and that the labor market has been giving a better signal of economic growth than gross domestic product. Even so, there may be more slack in the labor market than the unemployment rate of 5.3 percent indicates, he said.\n“The time is coming. I think most members of the FOMC at the June meeting believed that it was time to raise interest rates sometime this year,” Powell said. “When we do that, there will be -- if the economy continues to grow -- there will be a process of raising rates, gradually, over time.”\nPowell’s comments come after two of his colleagues signaled a willingness to raise interest rates next month for the first time since 2006.\nDennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed and a voting member this year of the FOMC, told the Wall Street Journal in a story published Tuesday that it would take a significant deterioration in the data to convince him not to begin in September.\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard told the Journal last week that “we are in good shape” for a rate increase next month.\nThe economy expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter, in line with Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s view that a dismal reading early in the year was transitory. Still, inflation hasn’t exceeded the Fed’s target for three years.\nEmployment reports for July and August will be released before the next FOMC meeting, set for Sept. 16-17, and will be followed by a Yellen press conference. The July jobs report will be released Friday, and the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists projects an increase of 225,000 jobs.",

The British pound is 11.3% stronger against the Euro than it was this time last year. The eurozone is the UK's biggest trade partner. \nA strong pound makes UK exports more expensive so traditional economic theory would lead one to expect a reduction in UK exports. \nHowever, the government tax cuts to the oil and gas industry which were introduced amidst an environment of falling oil prices and rising costs seems to have bolstered overall goods exports, at least in the short term. \nThe overall impact of the Office for National Statistics most recent data means that Britain's trade deficit in goods alone widened to £9.2bn in June from £8.4bn in the prior month; economists had forecast it to rise to £9.3bn. \nThe total trade deficit including services widened to £1.6bn in June from £0.9bn in May. \nThe total deficit is offset by a surplus generated from the export of services such as legal and banking products.",

Learn more... \nSun, Aug 9, 2015, 18:24 BST - UK Markets closed The surprising reason why some sneakers have fuzzy bottoms By Dennis Green | Business Insider – 24 minutes ago Print \n(Flickr/Chris Evans) A felt-like fuzz covers more than half of the sole of the sneaker. If you've ever wondered why your Converse All Stars have fuzzy bottoms, you may be disappointed to find out that it has less to do with \"increased traction\" (as some have speculated) and everything to do with the almighty dollar. \nThe felt soles on the bottoms of the All Stars — and other imported soles — are a perfect example of \"tariff engineering,\" explains the patent blog Gazetc.com . \nTranslation: The outsourced soles are specially designed to fetch a lower US import tax. \nIn this case, the special felt bottoms of the All Star cover more than 50% of the shoe's sole and allow it to be classified as a \"slipper.\" \nHere's the kicker: The tariff rate for for rubber-bottomed shoes is 37.5%, but classifying the shoe as a slipper lowers it to 3%. When you sell in the volume that Converse does, this adds up to a significant amount of savings. \nGazetc unearthed this weird fact after searching the patent code of the sole ( 6,430,844 ) on Google's patent searching engine. What comes back is not a patent for a shoe at all, but something that looks like — and is described as — a slipper. \n(US Patent and Trademark Office) The patent. \nFortunately, the fuzzy bottom doesn't affect the performance of the shoe. \nThough some have complained that their Chucks tend to be slippery out of the box, many have reported that the fuzz is not permanent and completely rubs after being worn for about a month.",

Learn more... \nSun, Aug 9, 2015, 18:24 BST - UK Markets closed The surprising reason why some sneakers have fuzzy bottoms By Dennis Green | Business Insider – 24 minutes ago Print \n(Flickr/Chris Evans) A felt-like fuzz covers more than half of the sole of the sneaker. If you've ever wondered why your Converse All Stars have fuzzy bottoms, you may be disappointed to find out that it has less to do with \"increased traction\" (as some have speculated) and everything to do with the almighty dollar. \nThe felt soles on the bottoms of the All Stars — and other imported soles — are a perfect example of \"tariff engineering,\" explains the patent blog Gazetc.com . \nTranslation: The outsourced soles are specially designed to fetch a lower US import tax. \nIn this case, the special felt bottoms of the All Star cover more than 50% of the shoe's sole and allow it to be classified as a \"slipper.\" \nHere's the kicker: The tariff rate for for rubber-bottomed shoes is 37.5%, but classifying the shoe as a slipper lowers it to 3%. When you sell in the volume that Converse does, this adds up to a significant amount of savings. \nGazetc unearthed this weird fact after searching the patent code of the sole ( 6,430,844 ) on Google's patent searching engine. What comes back is not a patent for a shoe at all, but something that looks like — and is described as — a slipper. \n(US Patent and Trademark Office) The patent. \nFortunately, the fuzzy bottom doesn't affect the performance of the shoe. \nThough some have complained that their Chucks tend to be slippery out of the box, many have reported that the fuzz is not permanent and completely rubs after being worn for about a month.",

However, testing will continue and the boiled water notice will not be lifted until United Utilities is absolutely satisfied that the water is back to the usual extremely high standards,\" United Utilities said. \nIt said investigations are ongoing as to how the bug found its way into the water at the treatment works. \nThe company put out a public information notice on Thursday urging customers to boil drinking water until further notice.",

Those problems left Boeing little margin for error in meeting an August 2017 deadline for delivering the first 18 tankers to the U.S. Air Force.\nIn July, Boeing took a $536 million after-tax accounting charge to cover design and development costs caused by other fuel system problems.\nBoeing later assigned Scott Fancher, a Boeing senior vice president and general manager of aircraft development, to oversee the tanker program. Fancher is credited with getting the 787 commercial jetliner program back on schedule after it fell more than three years behind its delivery target.\nUnder the fixed-price tanker contract, U.S. government costs are capped at $4.9 billion and Boeing is responsible for development costs above that cap.

Those were integrated into a new group called Sky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) in which Fox holds a minority position.",

Aug 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's Lexus brand is planning to launch a second top-of-the-line \"flagship\" model to accompany a new generation of its LS sedan, the head of the brand's U.S. operations told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\"We need a flagship. It doesn't have to be a sedan,\" Jeff Bracken, Lexus division general manager, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference.\nBracken would not say what type of vehicle the second flagship Lexus would be.\nSales of large luxury sedans such as the Lexus LS have slowed in recent years as affluent consumers have shifted toward luxury SUVs.\nRival luxury car makers have been winning customers with vehicles such as Tata Motors' Land Rover brand, the Cadillac Escalade from General Motors Co and large SUVs coming from the German luxury automakers. The SUV surge has prompted even luxury brands with no history of selling SUVs, such as BMW's Rolls-Royce, to develop models to compete in the super luxury SUV segment.\nU.S. sales have been supported by a prolonged drop in gasoline prices. Average prices at the pump on Tuesday were $2.63, down 25 percent from a year ago, according to the AAA travel group.\n\"In addition to the LS (a large sedan), there could be another flagship in our lineup,\" Bracken said. \"We'll define what it is in January.\"\nLexus also is looking to strengthen its SUV lineup by offering a version of the midsize RX SUV with a third row seat. An RX with room for seven or eight passengers is the No. 1 request from U.S. Lexus dealers, Bracken said. A new RX is due this fall but will not have a third row seat.\n\"We don't want to wait for a next generation\" to add the extra seating row, Bracken said.

He said that Oshkosh Corp. is “going to come back.” \nOlstein warned against investing in exchange-traded funds. \n“Unless you’re doing the research on the stocks within them, you’re taking a risk,” he said. \nWhile the overall market isn’t in a bubble, certain market segments including social media, biotechnology and some of the technology sector are in bubbles, Olstein said. Valuations for Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are too high, he said. \n“Wall Street Week” is produced by SkyBridge Media, an affiliate of SkyBridge Capital, the fund-of-funds business founded by Anthony Scaramucci. SkyBridge, which sometimes has other business relationships with the show’s participants, advertisers and sponsors, pays Fox stations in key markets to broadcast the show and also streams it online every Sunday at 11 a.m. in New York.",

He said that Oshkosh Corp. is “going to come back.” \nOlstein warned against investing in exchange-traded funds. \n“Unless you’re doing the research on the stocks within them, you’re taking a risk,” he said. \nWhile the overall market isn’t in a bubble, certain market segments including social media, biotechnology and some of the technology sector are in bubbles, Olstein said. Valuations for Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are too high, he said. \n“Wall Street Week” is produced by SkyBridge Media, an affiliate of SkyBridge Capital, the fund-of-funds business founded by Anthony Scaramucci. SkyBridge, which sometimes has other business relationships with the show’s participants, advertisers and sponsors, pays Fox stations in key markets to broadcast the show and also streams it online every Sunday at 11 a.m. in New York.",

Extensive solar panel production and the availability of raw materials, such as polysilicon, at very low prices are expected to elevate the growth of the market. \n“The Chinese government is providing financial support to encourage the development of the solar manufacturing industry, thus many vendors have heavily invested in setting up manufacturing facilities in China, which has significantly boosted the production of solar panels in the country,” adds Ghaus. \nTechnavio currently has more than 3000 market research reports on a huge range of topics, including:",

It's highly appropriate,\" he told reporters a day after the ratings on Chicago convention center bonds were severely downgraded as a result of the stalemate between Rauner and Democrats who control the state legislature.\nThe Republican governor, who took office in January, said he did not cause the fiscal problems engulfing the state and Chicago, its largest city, but he intends to fix them. He added the solution is reforming government, not higher taxes.\nIllinois' chronic budget deficits and big pension funding problems have left it with the lowest credit ratings and highest borrowing costs among the 50 states.\nStandard & Poor's warned last month it could take action on Illinois' A-minus rating by September if \"there is limited progress in budget deliberations or if credit fundamentals weaken.\" S&P has dropped only three states into the low-investment grade triple-B level: California in 2003, Massachusetts in 1989 and Louisiana in 1988.\nOn Wednesday, S&P and Fitch Ratings downgraded more than $3 billion of bonds issued by Chicago's Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority by several notches to BBB-plus because the lack of a state appropriation blocked a monthly transfer of tax revenue to the bond trustee.\nRauner continued to blast Democrats and House Speaker Michael Madigan for resisting his so-called turnaround agenda, which includes legislative term limits, a local property tax freeze coupled with curbs on collective bargaining, and business-friendly reforms. He said he is willing to support measures to rescue the Chicago Public Schools from crippling pension payments if city officials, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel, throw their support behind his reform agenda.\n\"This has got to be a two-way partnership,\" Rauner said.\n(Reporting by Karen Pierog ; Editing by Matthew Lewis )",

Many investors and economists see the Fed as most likely to start the rates \"liftoff\" next month as unemployment falls below its targets. Low inflation and still moderate growth, however, are seen holding the Fed back from aggressive rate hikes. \"I'm not sure what we're really going to glean from them today, everyone's hoping for some type of clue,\" said Tom Tucci, head of Treasuries trading at CIBC in New York. \"The market's trading like we're trying to reprice in higher yields.\" Benchmark 10-year notes fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.21 percent, up from 2.18 percent earlier on Wednesday. Following their two-day policy meeting in July, Fed officials said they felt the U.S. economy had overcome a first-quarter slowdown and was \"expanding moderately\" despite a downturn in the energy sector and headwinds from overseas. The U.S. economy and job market continue to strengthen, the Fed said. Yields fluctuated on Wednesday after data showed U.S. consumer prices rose in July, though the monthly increase came in below expectations. The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month after advancing 0.3 percent in June, marking the sixth straight monthly increase. In the 12-months through July, the CPI climbed 0.2 percent.

Growth rebounded this year, only to slow again as exports and consumption remained disappointingly weak.

Growth rebounded this year, only to slow again as exports and consumption remained disappointingly weak.

The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) - a gauge of shipping costs - dropped to its lowest point since 1985 during the period, with the market weighed down by \"an oversupplied fleet and a slowdown in seaborne demand\". \nThe declines in oil have meant that offshore drilling services have been left \"in a more challenging state than seen in many years\", Clarksons said. \"Consequently, few listed players are prepared to increase exposure or to raise capital for new projects.\" \nBut the oil price rout could be a windfall in the months to come. Clarksons said that lower fuel costs could contribute to \"a more positive global growth story\". \n\"There is a reason to believe that the market will have further upside, especially as the seasonal demand story impacts in the fourth quarter,\" it reported. \nFollowing Clarksons's £280m acquisition of Platou this February, Mr Case said that he was \"delighted to report that the pace of integration of our two businesses has been going well\". \nAdministrative costs rose 29pc to £115.4m as the company absorbed the acquisition; however Clarksons said it anticipated cost savings of £4m a year in due course.",

Learn more... \nMon, Aug 17, 2015, 09:22 BST - UK Markets close in 7 hrs 8 mins Shipping company Clarksons hit by global oil price rout By Peter Spence | Telegraph – 27 minutes ago \nFTSE 250-listed freight company's profits slide on the weaker price of oil \nThe profits of shipping company Clarksons have been hit by a slump in commodity prices. \nPre (Shanghai: 600048.SS - news ) -tax profits slid to just £10.8m in the half-year to the end of June, down from £14.1m in the same period a year earlier, according to an interim results statement on Monday . \nAndi Case, chief executive of Clarksons, said: \"The multi-cyclical and volatile nature of our markets has once again been demonstrated by the sudden shift in oil and other commodity prices.\" \nThe global shipping industry has been contending with headwinds from tumbling commodity prices for months. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) - a gauge of shipping costs - dropped to its lowest point since 1985 during the period, with the market weighed down by \"an oversupplied fleet and a slowdown in seaborne demand\". \nThe declines in oil have meant that offshore drilling services have been left \"in a more challenging state than seen in many years\", Clarksons said. \"Consequently, few listed players are prepared to increase exposure or to raise capital for new projects.\" \nBut the oil price rout could be a windfall in the months to come. Clarksons said that lower fuel costs could contribute to \"a more positive global growth story\". \n\"There is a reason to believe that the market will have further upside, especially as the seasonal demand story impacts in the fourth quarter,\" it reported. \nFollowing Clarksons's £280m acquisition of Platou this February, Mr Case said that he was \"delighted to report that the pace of integration of our two businesses has been going well\". \nAdministrative costs rose 29pc to £115.4m as the company absorbed the acquisition; however Clarksons said it anticipated cost savings of £4m a year in due course.",
