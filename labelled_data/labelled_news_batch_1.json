This would bring its two-day increase to about 22 basis points, which would be largest such jump since early July 2013, according to Reuters data.\n(Reporting by Richard Leong ; Editing by Diane Craft )",

This would bring its two-day increase to about 22 basis points, which would be largest such jump since early July 2013, according to Reuters data.\n(Reporting by Richard Leong ; Editing by Diane Craft )",

NPS is not obligated to follow KCGS’s recommendation, Chi said.\nThe advice comes ahead of NPS’s decision on what may turn into the biggest proxy fight Korea has ever seen. The contest pits billionaire activist Paul Elliott Singer against the founding family of the country’s largest conglomerate, Samsung Group, amid a leadership transition. The state-run pension fund’s actions will be a key to the outcome as it may have the swing vote with its 10.15 percent stake in Samsung C&T.\nIn May, Samsung’s de facto holding company Cheil announced that it would acquire Samsung C&T. The deal would solidify the 47-year-old Lee Jae Yong’s control over Samsung Group, including the crown jewel, Samsung Electronics Co. C&T also owns about $10 billion of group company shares, making it a vital asset to Lee and his siblings who control Cheil.\nSinger took a stake in Samsung C&T and has argued that the all-stock takeover offer “significantly undervalues” the target’s worth. The proposed deal would pass 7.8 trillion won ($6.8 billion) of C&T book value to Cheil without compensation, according to Elliott.\nNPS, which has more than $430 billion in assets and is overseen by the nation’s health ministry, has declined to comment on how it will vote.",

The leaders of India, Brazil and South Africa are also attending the BRICS summit.\nThe Russian Finance Ministry plans to borrow around 800 billion roubles on the domestic market in 2015.\nThe bond purchase by China suggests high-yielding Russian assets remain attractive to certain overseas investors, despite sanctions and volatility in the Russian rouble, in which so-called OFZ bonds are denominated.\nEarlier, sources told Reuters that the purchase took place outside the Finance Ministry's weekly OFZ auctions and at different times.\n($1 = 57.1364 roubles) (Reporting by Darya Korsunskaya; Writing by Lidia Kelly; Editing by Alexander Winning and Gareth Jones)",

        "text": "Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc may buy back 10 billion pounds ($15.5 billion) of stock in 2016 if the lender reduces its risk-weighted assets by 125 billion pounds, according to Investec Plc.\nRBS has 350 billion pounds of such assets on its balance sheet and is projected to cut that total to 225 billion pounds by the end of next year as loans run off and assets are sold, Investec analyst Ian Gordon said Tuesday. The U.K. plans to start selling its controlling stake this year, even as RBS faces a U.S. misconduct fine that may reach $13 billion.\n“Material uncertainty remains around the terms on which various conduct issues may be resolved, but does little to diminish our buyback expectations” given “the emergence of material surplus capital driven by planned RWA reduction,” Gordon, who rates RBS a buy, said in a report. “We continue to anticipate at least a 10 billion-pound share buyback in 2016.”\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is preparing to sell shares in RBS as early as September, probably at a loss to the Treasury, as the government seeks to end seven years of ownership and return some of the 45.5 billion-pound bailout to taxpayers. Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan, 57, has reversed RBS’s global expansion and is focusing the lender on U.K. consumer and commercial banking, reducing assets at the investment bank and closing businesses abroad.\nRBS shares fell 1 percent to 343.4 pence at 11:20 a.m. in London, extending its decline this year to 13 percent.\nA large fine could affect the timetable for returning RBS to private ownership. U.S. regulators told the bank it could pay as much as $13 billion if it loses a lawsuit over its handling of American mortgage securities.\nThat sum “appears very much worst case,” Gordon said. “We think RBS’s existing 2 billion-pound provision would be short by only a few hundred million dollars.”",

        "text_full": "RBS May Buy Back $15.5 Billion of Stock in 2016, Investec Says\nRoyal Bank of Scotland Group Plc may buy back 10 billion pounds ($15.5 billion) of stock in 2016 if the lender reduces its risk-weighted assets by 125 billion pounds, according to Investec Plc.\nRBS has 350 billion pounds of such assets on its balance sheet and is projected to cut that total to 225 billion pounds by the end of next year as loans run off and assets are sold, Investec analyst Ian Gordon said Tuesday. The U.K. plans to start selling its controlling stake this year, even as RBS faces a U.S. misconduct fine that may reach $13 billion.\n“Material uncertainty remains around the terms on which various conduct issues may be resolved, but does little to diminish our buyback expectations” given “the emergence of material surplus capital driven by planned RWA reduction,” Gordon, who rates RBS a buy, said in a report. “We continue to anticipate at least a 10 billion-pound share buyback in 2016.”\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is preparing to sell shares in RBS as early as September, probably at a loss to the Treasury, as the government seeks to end seven years of ownership and return some of the 45.5 billion-pound bailout to taxpayers. Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan, 57, has reversed RBS’s global expansion and is focusing the lender on U.K. consumer and commercial banking, reducing assets at the investment bank and closing businesses abroad.\nRBS shares fell 1 percent to 343.4 pence at 11:20 a.m. in London, extending its decline this year to 13 percent.\nA large fine could affect the timetable for returning RBS to private ownership. U.S. regulators told the bank it could pay as much as $13 billion if it loses a lawsuit over its handling of American mortgage securities.\nThat sum “appears very much worst case,” Gordon said. “We think RBS’s existing 2 billion-pound provision would be short by only a few hundred million dollars.”",

In the poll of 630 CFOs, 37 percent of those in Singapore said they expect earnings to grow in 2015, about half the regional average.\nA weak global environment and sluggish domestic market are driving the negative sentiment, according to the bank. Four-fifths of Singapore CFOs also cited U.S. interest-rate movements as a key risk this year, while about half said they were considering a change in their China strategies.\nSingapore&apos;s exports were one-and-a-half times its gross domestic product last year, the highest share in Asia except for Hong Kong. The small and open economy is sometimes seen as a bellwether for the region, especially as it tends to report monthly trade data earlier than its neighbors.\n &apos;It&apos;s the most open and trade-oriented economy in the region and it&apos;s impacted by the vagaries of the global trade cycle,&apos;&apos; said Michael Wan, a Singapore-based economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. The CFOs \"could be looking at the outside world from the lens of a regional headquarters,&apos;&apos; he said.\nGranted, there are domestic factors weighing on corporate leaders&apos; minds in Singapore. Most significantly, the government has slowed the inflow of cheap foreign workers since 2010, resulting in a labor crunch that has raised business costs.\nStill, Singapore&apos;s non-oil domestic shipments fell for the first time in three months in May, as exports dropped in Thailand, China and India. The island&apos;s financial officers may be on to something.",

In the poll of 630 CFOs, 37 percent of those in Singapore said they expect earnings to grow in 2015, about half the regional average.\nA weak global environment and sluggish domestic market are driving the negative sentiment, according to the bank. Four-fifths of Singapore CFOs also cited U.S. interest-rate movements as a key risk this year, while about half said they were considering a change in their China strategies.\nSingapore&apos;s exports were one-and-a-half times its gross domestic product last year, the highest share in Asia except for Hong Kong. The small and open economy is sometimes seen as a bellwether for the region, especially as it tends to report monthly trade data earlier than its neighbors.\n &apos;It&apos;s the most open and trade-oriented economy in the region and it&apos;s impacted by the vagaries of the global trade cycle,&apos;&apos; said Michael Wan, a Singapore-based economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. The CFOs \"could be looking at the outside world from the lens of a regional headquarters,&apos;&apos; he said.\nGranted, there are domestic factors weighing on corporate leaders&apos; minds in Singapore. Most significantly, the government has slowed the inflow of cheap foreign workers since 2010, resulting in a labor crunch that has raised business costs.\nStill, Singapore&apos;s non-oil domestic shipments fell for the first time in three months in May, as exports dropped in Thailand, China and India. The island&apos;s financial officers may be on to something.",

Tenants in the higher-income brackets affected by the change represent about 9 percent of all social tenants in England, benefiting on average from more than 3,500 pounds per household in reduced rent, the official said.\nThe move -- dubbed “Pay to Stay” -- may raise as much as 250 million pounds a year. Additional rental income received by local authorities from ending those subsidies will be used to pay down Britain’s national debt.

        "text": "* Nikkei slips 0.4 pct, Topix dips 0.1 pct * Fast Retailing slides after June drop in Uniqlo sales * Cross-shareholding reduction plan lifts SMFG By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, July 3 Japan's Nikkei share average drifted lower on Friday as caution ahead of a Greek national vote over the weekend suppressed investors' appetite for risk, with Fast Retailing Co sliding after it reported a drop in domestic sales. The Nikkei share average lost 0.4 percent to 20,431.25 by mid-morning, weighed down by Wall Street's tepid performance overnight after U.S. non-farm payrolls data that was not quite as strong as expected. Still, a relatively calm view towards the pending Greek referendum limited the Nikkei's fall. \"Some see the Greeks supporting fiscal austerity on Sunday. If they do support austerity, equities will likely rise next week, and such a possibility is curbing the selling today,\" said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. Greek voters will head to the polls on Sunday to either accept or reject an international bailout deal, a step that could decide the future of their cash-strapped country's place in Europe. Fast Retailing was down 4 percent after it said on Thursday that same-store sales at its Uniqlo clothing outlets in Japan fell 11.7 percent in June from a year earlier. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group rose 2.2 percent after a report that it will create targets by this fall to reduce cross-shareholdings. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial's gains were positive for other banking shares such as Mizuho Financial Group Inc, which rose 1.3 percent, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group , which climbed 0.9 percent. The broader Topix fell 0.1 percent to 1,646.13. The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 shed 0.1 percent to 14,867.92. (Editing by Edmund Klamann)",

The Nikkei share average lost 0.4 percent to 20,431.25 by mid-morning, weighed down by Wall Street's tepid performance overnight after U.S. non-farm payrolls data that was not quite as strong as expected. Still, a relatively calm view towards the pending Greek referendum limited the Nikkei's fall. \"Some see the Greeks supporting fiscal austerity on Sunday. If they do support austerity, equities will likely rise next week, and such a possibility is curbing the selling today,\" said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. Greek voters will head to the polls on Sunday to either accept or reject an international bailout deal, a step that could decide the future of their cash-strapped country's place in Europe. Fast Retailing was down 4 percent after it said on Thursday that same-store sales at its Uniqlo clothing outlets in Japan fell 11.7 percent in June from a year earlier. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group rose 2.2 percent after a report that it will create targets by this fall to reduce cross-shareholdings. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial's gains were positive for other banking shares such as Mizuho Financial Group Inc, which rose 1.3 percent, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group , which climbed 0.9 percent. The broader Topix fell 0.1 percent to 1,646.13. The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 shed 0.1 percent to 14,867.92. (Editing by Edmund Klamann)",

The new spending, which is equivalent to 1 percent of gross domestic product, will boost growth by 0.3 percentage points and help create 124,000 jobs, according to the ministry.\nPresident Park Geun Hye’s approval rating is near a record low as the nation struggles to contain the fallout from the spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which has claimed at least 33 lives and prompted the government to cut its economic growth forecast for 2015.\n“This year’s extra budget won’t significantly boost growth because much of the spending is tailored for MERS, but it will at least prevent consumption from falling further,” said Yoon Yeo Sam, a Seoul-based fixed-income analyst at Daewoo Securities Co.\nSome 2.5 trillion won will be allocated to medical institutions and the tourism industry, with another 3.1 trillion won going to small businesses that are struggling to pay wages to their workers, the ministry said. Loans will be made on relaxed terms to affected companies while people who have lost their jobs will be retrained.\n‘Difficult Condition’ Finance Minister Choi Kyung Hwan on Thursday said the economy was in a “very difficult condition” because of MERS and a drought. The parliament needs to approve the extra budget -- which increases the spending power of the national government and state-run funds -- swiftly after it is submitted on July 6, Choi said.\nAn additional 9.6 trillion won in treasury bonds will be issued this year, taking sales to 110.3 trillion won for 2015, the finance ministry estimates.\nThey will be sold via auctions distributed evenly during the remainder of 2015 to make sure the extra supply doesn’t add to market volatility, it said.\nGovernment debt will increase to 37.5 percent of GDP, or 579.5 trillion won, after the supplementary budget, the ministry forecasts, compared with 35.7 percent of GDP projected earlier.",

The company, which has agreed to be bought by Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) , posted net income of $429m, down from £1.21bn a year ago, on revenue of $3.98bn, down 28% from $5.50bn. \nThe drop in revenue reflects a significant fall in realised sales prices, impacting both the Upstream and LNG Shipping & Marketing segments. However, the impact of lower prices was partly offset by higher volumes in both segments, with E&P production volumes up 19% and LNG volumes up 17%. \nNet cash flow from operating activities decreased 56% to $926m. \nFor the half year, group earnings fell 58% to $994m and the company maintained its interim dividend of 14.38 cents per share. \nIt was a brighter picture in terms of production, however, which rose to record levels. Exploration and production rose 19% to 703,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the company said it now expects output for the year to be in the upper half of its forecast range of 650,000 to 690,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. \nChief executive Helge Lund said: \"We achieved a number of key milestones during the quarter while continuing to deliver on our cost and efficiency programmes.\" RBC Capital Markets said the results revealed a \"solid operational performance\" with earnings ahead of both its and consensus forecasts, which were around $317m, adding that progress at key projects continues to be positive.

The lower rates brought an incentive for prospective purchasers toward the end of the spring home buying season. \nMortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 4.04 percent this week from 4.08 percent a week earlier. The rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages eased to 3.20 percent from 3.24 percent. \nMarkets around the world have been nervously watching tumult and a nearly month-long slide in China's stock markets, and Greece's economic crisis as it tries to negotiate a rescue from its European partners. That has pushed investors to seek safety in U.S. Treasury bonds, pushing interest rates lower. \nBond yields for Treasurys have been pushed lower by the rise in bond prices. The yield on the key 10-year Treasury note dropped to 2.20 percent Wednesday from 2.42 percent a week earlier. Mortgage rates often follow the yield on the 10-year note. It traded at 2.27 percent Thursday morning. \nTo calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country at the beginning of each week. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount. \nThe average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged from last week at 0.6 point. The fee for a 15-year loan fell to 0.5 point from 0.6 point. \nThe average rate on five-year adjustable-rate mortgages fell to 2.93 percent from 2.99 percent; the fee remained at 0.4 point.

Problems in Greece and China ``chip away at the confidence that there&apos;s not much standing in the way of an economic rebound.&apos;&apos;\n The sale also benefits from the relative value of Treasuries that yield more than comparable maturity government bonds of 15 other developed nations, according to data comiled by Bloomberg.\n Investors remain concerned that Greece may falter as it approaches a July 12 deadline for packaging economic policy changes that will persuade European creditors that it should remain in the euro. Policy makers in China remain unable to halt a plunge in the country&apos;s stock market while a global drop in the price of commodities has reduced inflation expectations and added to risk-averse conditions.\nThe securities yielded 2.225 percent, compared with an average forecast of 2.243 percent in a survey of six of the Federal Reserve&apos;s 22 primary dealers.\n The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.72, down from 2.74 in June. It was higher than the average of 2.67 at the 10 previous offerings.\n The ratio is 2.84 for the entire $1.102 trillion in notes and bonds sold this year, compared with 2.98 in 2014.\nThe Treasury is scheduled to auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds Thursday. It sold $24 billion of three-year notes Tuesday at a yield of 0.932 percent.",

Problems in Greece and China ``chip away at the confidence that there&apos;s not much standing in the way of an economic rebound.&apos;&apos;\n The sale also benefits from the relative value of Treasuries that yield more than comparable maturity government bonds of 15 other developed nations, according to data comiled by Bloomberg.\n Investors remain concerned that Greece may falter as it approaches a July 12 deadline for packaging economic policy changes that will persuade European creditors that it should remain in the euro. Policy makers in China remain unable to halt a plunge in the country&apos;s stock market while a global drop in the price of commodities has reduced inflation expectations and added to risk-averse conditions.\nThe securities yielded 2.225 percent, compared with an average forecast of 2.243 percent in a survey of six of the Federal Reserve&apos;s 22 primary dealers.\n The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.72, down from 2.74 in June. It was higher than the average of 2.67 at the 10 previous offerings.\n The ratio is 2.84 for the entire $1.102 trillion in notes and bonds sold this year, compared with 2.98 in 2014.\nThe Treasury is scheduled to auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds Thursday. It sold $24 billion of three-year notes Tuesday at a yield of 0.932 percent.",

Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Thursday that an interest rate hike is likely this year, repeating comments from Wednesday made as part of her semi-annual testimony to Congress. \"People are realizing what she said, that every meeting is on the table going forward, and thinking maybe we shouldn't be long the front-end,\" said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. Two-year year notes was last down 1/32 in price to yield 0.67 percent, up from 0.63 percent late on Wednesday. Benchmark 10-year notes were flat to yield 2.36 percent. The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 146 basis points from 151 basis points. Concerns about Greece leaving the euro zone also eased after European creditors moved cautiously towards re-opening funding to Greece's stricken economy on Thursday. \"There is a little bit of an unwind of the safe haven bid from yesterday,\" said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York, adding \"flows have been very light.\" U.S. economic data was mixed on Thursday. The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to a solid labor market. Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region, however, expanded in July at a slower pace than expected, and a measurement of employment contracted, a survey showed on Thursday. Consumer price data will be in focus on Friday. (Editing by Bernadette Baum )",

Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Thursday that an interest rate hike is likely this year, repeating comments from Wednesday made as part of her semi-annual testimony to Congress. \"People are realizing what she said, that every meeting is on the table going forward, and thinking maybe we shouldn't be long the front-end,\" said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. Two-year year notes was last down 1/32 in price to yield 0.67 percent, up from 0.63 percent late on Wednesday. Benchmark 10-year notes were flat to yield 2.36 percent. The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 146 basis points from 151 basis points. Concerns about Greece leaving the euro zone also eased after European creditors moved cautiously towards re-opening funding to Greece's stricken economy on Thursday. \"There is a little bit of an unwind of the safe haven bid from yesterday,\" said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York, adding \"flows have been very light.\" U.S. economic data was mixed on Thursday. The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to a solid labor market. Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region, however, expanded in July at a slower pace than expected, and a measurement of employment contracted, a survey showed on Thursday. Consumer price data will be in focus on Friday. (Editing by Bernadette Baum )",

The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month, the fifth straight increase. Last month's increase pushed the year-on-year CPI rate into positive territory for the first time since December. U.S. housing starts also rebounded strongly in June and building permits surged to a near eight-year high, pointing to a rapidly strengthening housing market. \"The housing sector this year has been one of the only sectors that has shown consistent strength, so that continuing I think bodes well for the overall economy,\" said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. \"CPI came in pretty close to expectations.\" The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 139 basis points, the flattest since June 17. Benchmark 10-year notes were little changed to yield 2.35 percent. The yield curve has flattened since Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday an interest rate increase is likely this year. Many investors and economists view the Fed's September meeting as the most likely time for an initial hike. (Editing by Paul Simao)",

The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month, the fifth straight increase. Last month's increase pushed the year-on-year CPI rate into positive territory for the first time since December. U.S. housing starts also rebounded strongly in June and building permits surged to a near eight-year high, pointing to a rapidly strengthening housing market. \"The housing sector this year has been one of the only sectors that has shown consistent strength, so that continuing I think bodes well for the overall economy,\" said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. \"CPI came in pretty close to expectations.\" The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 139 basis points, the flattest since June 17. Benchmark 10-year notes were little changed to yield 2.35 percent. The yield curve has flattened since Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday an interest rate increase is likely this year. Many investors and economists view the Fed's September meeting as the most likely time for an initial hike. (Editing by Paul Simao)",

This is “counterbalanced somewhat by disinflation.”\nThe comments, the governor’s first on monetary policy in weeks, came shortly after data showed Britain’s inflation rate fell back to zero in June, led by prices for food and clothing. The BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee is nevertheless focused on the outlook for the labor market, with a pickup in wage growth prompting some members to say an increase in interest rates will be needed soon.\n“Wages are beginning to grow, interest rates are at historically low levels, and so households should begin to manage their finances with the assumption that there should be an upward adjustment in interest rates,” Carney said. “There will inevitably be shocks and adjustments” given high debt levels, though households “have been making progress in reducing their exposure.”\nCarney also reiterated his expectation that the path for interest-rate increases would be limited and gradual. Investor expectations for the first interest rate increases have shifted to May 2016 from August of that year.\n‘Weak Investment’ Policy maker David Miles said that despite the central bank keeping its key interest rate at 0.5 percent, people’s inflation expectations “seem quite anchored” two or three years ahead. The bank has held the key rate at that record-low level since March 2009.\n“We have had relatively weak investment over the last few years, but my view is this is not a long-term downward shift in people’s desire to invest, more about being in a deep recession,” Miles said. “We’re still dealing with the thankfully fading crisis of 2008, and I don’t think that’s a guide for new normal interest rates.”\nData on Wednesday will show earnings rose an annual 3 percent in the three months through May, compared with 2.7 percent in April, economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Including bonuses, wages increased 3.3 percent. Unemployment probably stayed at its lowest since 2008.",

TUI said it did not currently have any customers in the country.\nA total of 38 people were killed when Saif Rezgui opened fire on holidaymakers at the resort of Sousse two weeks ago. In March, two gunmen killed 24 people dead, 21 of them foreign tourists, in an attack at the Bardo museum in the Tunisian capital Tunis.\nThe cancellation of holidays to Tunisia could prove costly for TUI and Thomas Cook.\nHolidays in North Africa account for about 10 percent of their total passengers, with Tunisia about a third of that.\nShares in the two tour operators have fallen over the last two weeks, hurt mainly by the deadly attack on tourists at Sousse and the cost of cancellations and rebooking.

TUI said it did not currently have any customers in the country.\nA total of 38 people were killed when Saif Rezgui opened fire on holidaymakers at the resort of Sousse two weeks ago. In March, two gunmen killed 24 people dead, 21 of them foreign tourists, in an attack at the Bardo museum in the Tunisian capital Tunis.\nThe cancellation of holidays to Tunisia could prove costly for TUI and Thomas Cook.\nHolidays in North Africa account for about 10 percent of their total passengers, with Tunisia about a third of that.\nShares in the two tour operators have fallen over the last two weeks, hurt mainly by the deadly attack on tourists at Sousse and the cost of cancellations and rebooking.

NYSE said the outage was due to an internal technical issue and not the result of a cyberattack. Other exchanges were trading normally.\nThe NYSE must now verify the cause and report its conclusions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which will use those findings to investigate whether any violation of rules occurred, Bloomberg reported.

NYSE said the outage was due to an internal technical issue and not the result of a cyberattack. Other exchanges were trading normally.\nThe NYSE must now verify the cause and report its conclusions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which will use those findings to investigate whether any violation of rules occurred, Bloomberg reported.

        "text": "A private gauge of Chinese manufacturing unexpectedly fell to the lowest in 15 months, reinforcing the need for further policy support in an economy that had seen signs of stabilization recently.\nThe preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index from Caixin Media and Markit Economics was at 48.2 for July, down from 49.4 the previous month. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for an increase to 49.7.

Learn more... \nSat, Jul 18, 2015, 18:41 BST - UK Markets closed Merkel ally urges German MPs who voted against Greek aid talks to rethink Reuters – 45 minutes ago Print \nBERLIN (Reuters) - The general secretary of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats has urged lawmakers who voted against opening talks on a third financial rescue for Greece to reconsider. \nGerman lawmakers on Friday gave Berlin approval to negotiate a third bailout for Greece by 439 votes to 119, with 40 abstentions. There was a sizeable rebellion among Merkel's conservatives, with nearly a fifth voting \"no\". \nIn an advance copy of an interview to be published in newspaper Tagessspiegel on Sunday, Peter Tauber said those members of parliament should think of some words of former Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, father of the West German federal republic, that no one could prevent him from becoming wiser. \nThe Bundestag will have to vote again on any agreement between Greece and its creditors for a third bailout. \nTauber said the suffering of the Greek people \"doesn't leave any of us cold\" but the examples of Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Ireland showed it was possible to successfully overcome the debt crisis. \n\"So, after successful negotiations with Greece, there can be reasons for a 'yes', even for those who have said 'no' up until now,\" Tauber said. \nHe said a Greek exit from the euro zone was off the cards at the moment, but warned: \"Europe has not given Greece a blank cheque, there are very clear expectations and if Greece doesn't fulfil them, then we'll sit back down at the table very quickly.\" \n(Reporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by David Holmes)",

Learn more... \nSat, Jul 18, 2015, 18:41 BST - UK Markets closed Merkel ally urges German MPs who voted against Greek aid talks to rethink Reuters – 45 minutes ago Print \nBERLIN (Reuters) - The general secretary of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats has urged lawmakers who voted against opening talks on a third financial rescue for Greece to reconsider. \nGerman lawmakers on Friday gave Berlin approval to negotiate a third bailout for Greece by 439 votes to 119, with 40 abstentions. There was a sizeable rebellion among Merkel's conservatives, with nearly a fifth voting \"no\". \nIn an advance copy of an interview to be published in newspaper Tagessspiegel on Sunday, Peter Tauber said those members of parliament should think of some words of former Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, father of the West German federal republic, that no one could prevent him from becoming wiser. \nThe Bundestag will have to vote again on any agreement between Greece and its creditors for a third bailout. \nTauber said the suffering of the Greek people \"doesn't leave any of us cold\" but the examples of Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Ireland showed it was possible to successfully overcome the debt crisis. \n\"So, after successful negotiations with Greece, there can be reasons for a 'yes', even for those who have said 'no' up until now,\" Tauber said. \nHe said a Greek exit from the euro zone was off the cards at the moment, but warned: \"Europe has not given Greece a blank cheque, there are very clear expectations and if Greece doesn't fulfil them, then we'll sit back down at the table very quickly.\" \n(Reporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by David Holmes)",

( http://s.nikkei.com/1f8Sxu3 ) \nQuarterly sales were expected to fall by 3.2 percent to 600 billion yen. \nSharp officials weren't immediately available to comment. \nThe figures were both slightly weaker than markets were expecting, and shares in Sharp fell 3 percent in morning trade. Analysts on average forecast an operating loss of 21 billion yen on sales of 612 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. \nSharp has struggled to cope with falling prices for liquid crystal displays sold to smartphone makers. In May, it secured a $1.9 billion bailout after falling deep into the red. \nSharp's earnings for the July-September period would have to improve \"significantly\" for the company to reach its targeted operating profit of 10 billion yen for the April-September half, the report said. \n(Reporting by Sneha Banerjee in BENGALURU and Ritsuko Ando in TOKYO; Editing by Richard Pullin and Kenneth Maxwell)",

( http://s.nikkei.com/1f8Sxu3 ) \nQuarterly sales were expected to fall by 3.2 percent to 600 billion yen. \nSharp officials weren't immediately available to comment. \nThe figures were both slightly weaker than markets were expecting, and shares in Sharp fell 3 percent in morning trade. Analysts on average forecast an operating loss of 21 billion yen on sales of 612 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. \nSharp has struggled to cope with falling prices for liquid crystal displays sold to smartphone makers. In May, it secured a $1.9 billion bailout after falling deep into the red. \nSharp's earnings for the July-September period would have to improve \"significantly\" for the company to reach its targeted operating profit of 10 billion yen for the April-September half, the report said. \n(Reporting by Sneha Banerjee in BENGALURU and Ritsuko Ando in TOKYO; Editing by Richard Pullin and Kenneth Maxwell)",

OPEC is assuming that demand will pick up in the second half of the year,\" he added. \nThe US Department of Energy on Wednesday said the country's commercial crude stockpiles rose 2.5 million barrels last week, while supplies at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma, hub were up 800,000 barrels. \nThe report also showed US production staying at near-record levels of about 9.6 million barrels per day, bad news for a market already awash with crude from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). \n\"US inventories expanded more than expected... which exacerbated the oversupply problem, especially when Saudi is pumping at record production levels,\" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore. \n\"OPEC produced 32.1 million barrels per day in June, with the largest increase coming from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This was 2.1 million more than what the organisation said it will maintain,\" Aw added. \nA strong US currency is putting further downward pressure on oil. With the commodity priced in dollars, it becomes more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, denting demand. \nExpectations that the US central bank is on track to raise interest rates this year have boosted the dollar as investors flock to the currency in the hope of getting better returns.",

OPEC is assuming that demand will pick up in the second half of the year,\" he added. \nThe US Department of Energy on Wednesday said the country's commercial crude stockpiles rose 2.5 million barrels last week, while supplies at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma, hub were up 800,000 barrels. \nThe report also showed US production staying at near-record levels of about 9.6 million barrels per day, bad news for a market already awash with crude from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). \n\"US inventories expanded more than expected... which exacerbated the oversupply problem, especially when Saudi is pumping at record production levels,\" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore. \n\"OPEC produced 32.1 million barrels per day in June, with the largest increase coming from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This was 2.1 million more than what the organisation said it will maintain,\" Aw added. \nA strong US currency is putting further downward pressure on oil. With the commodity priced in dollars, it becomes more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, denting demand. \nExpectations that the US central bank is on track to raise interest rates this year have boosted the dollar as investors flock to the currency in the hope of getting better returns.",

The purchase will be charged on the user's Uber account and the handset will be delivered shortly thereafter to his or her physical location.\nFor Xiaomi, a company renowned for its marketing savvy, the partnership could generate more buzz for a product launch at a time when it is looking to expand rapidly into markets like Southeast Asia and India.

It had revenues last year of $8 billion and worked with 10 million merchants worldwide.",

It had revenues last year of $8 billion and worked with 10 million merchants worldwide.",
