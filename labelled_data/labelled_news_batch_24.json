        "text": "* Lower oil prices hit oil shares, lift airline stocks\n* U.S. earnings to determine market directions this week - analysts\n* China trade data eyed\nBy Ayai Tomisawa\nTOKYO, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average fell on Tuesday morning as profit-taking from last week's gains hit home and oil-related stocks were sold on lower oil prices.\nSharp Corp defied the weakness and surged as much as 10.1 percent after Reuters reported that a Japanese government-backed fund is considering a range of options to help turn around the struggling company - including direct investment.\nThe Nikkei dropped 1.0 percent to 18,247.25 in mid-morning trade after rising 4 percent last week.\nInvestors returned to the market after a three-day weekend in Japan due to a national holiday, and didn't waste their time selling oil-related stocks after oil prices tumbled on Monday. Inpex Corp fell 3.6 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co shed 1.9 percent.\nTrading houses were also lower, with Mitsubishi Corp shed 2.5 percent and Mitsui & Co dropped 2.2 percent.\nOil stumbled 5 percent as traders took profits after last week's surge to an 11-week high, and on a report that OPEC continued to boost crude production despite a persistent glut.\nAirline shares, which benefit from lower fuel costs from cheaper oil, outperformed. ANA Holdings rose 2.2 percent and Japan Airlines Co gained 2.6 percent.\nAnalysts said that while there was a lack of market-moving domestic catalysts, U.S. earnings announcements may set the direction until the end of the month, when many central banks around the world are scheduled to have policy meetings.\n\"Investors brace for weak earnings, but if U.S. companies give positive surprises, the market may be supported,\" said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities.\nHe also said that investors were focused on China's just-published trade data. \"China's imports, which measure domestic demand, are especially closely watched,\" Kuramochi said.\nThe broader Topix dropped 0.6 percent to 1,505.92 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 slid 0.7 percent to 13,499.73.\n(Reporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Eric Meijer)",

There were also concerns that the proposals could be expanded.\n\"We are concerned that this is an opening salvo that could eventually lead to a proposal to tax mom and pop investors,\" said Bill Harts, chief executive officer of HFT advocacy group Modern Markets Initiative.\nClinton would also pursue additional oversight of the \"shadow-banking\" sector by imposing other margin and collateral requirements on risky short-term borrowing; review recent regulatory changes to the money market fund industry for possible holes; create new reporting requirements for hedge funds and private equity firms; and strengthen the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\nUnless the Democrats win a majority in the Senate and retake the House of Representatives in the 2016 elections, the chances of the proposals being enacted are low, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note to clients.

In contrast, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was flat, while Germany's DAX was up 0.1 percent. \nBoE policymakers voted 8-1 to keep rates at a record-low 0.5 percent, and most saw a relatively soft outlook for inflation.

In contrast, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was flat, while Germany's DAX was up 0.1 percent. \nBoE policymakers voted 8-1 to keep rates at a record-low 0.5 percent, and most saw a relatively soft outlook for inflation.

To receive the monthly reward, customers must stay in credit, pay in £750 a month, and make two monthly direct debit payments. \nMoneywise Verdict: Halifax’s current account has one of the more generous sign up packages, and if you’re looking to sign up anyway this is a nice extra. It’s not a good idea to open an account just to enter the prize draw though. \nIf you’re looking to open an account for the sign-up offer, also consider first direct as it pays £150 to anyone joining via moneysupermarket.com. They’ll also give you another £100 if you’re not happy with the service after six months. \nThe gift voucher offer is less compelling. Halifax’s mortgages aren’t close to the top of the best buy tables, and they’ll only lend up to 85% loan-to-value, so they’re not ideal for first-time buyers. You’d probably save more overall by ignoring this and going with a broker’s recommendation.",

Its existing mining contract ends in 2021, but present rules only allows talks on an extension to start two years before a contract is due to end.\n\"A revision to the government regulation on the time of a contract extension proposal, is now being processed in the economics ministry,\" Bambang Gatot, director general of coal and mineral at the mines ministry told reporters on Friday.\n\"We expect it can be released soon, this year,\" he said.\nThe new rules may allow companies to proprose an extension 10 years before their contracts expire.\nFreeport said on Thursday it had been assured by the government of Indonesia that the contract for its Grasberg mine in the eastern province of Papua would be extended beyond 2021.\nThe government has been rolling out new measures to re-energise Southeast Asia's largest economy after growth cooled in the second quarter to 4.67 percent, the slowest pace in six years.\nPresident Joko Widodo has shown signs that the government is trying to mend fences with wary investors following a series of nationalistic policies by the previous administration.\nFreeport plans to invest $18 billion to transition the Grasberg complex from an open pit to underground mining in late 2017. The company currently produces about 220,000 tonnes of copper ore per day, which is then converted to copper concentrate.\nThe move on a contract extension comes after the U.S. miner previously reached agreements on higher royalties, an export tax and domestic processing and divestment.

Its existing mining contract ends in 2021, but present rules only allows talks on an extension to start two years before a contract is due to end.\n\"A revision to the government regulation on the time of a contract extension proposal, is now being processed in the economics ministry,\" Bambang Gatot, director general of coal and mineral at the mines ministry told reporters on Friday.\n\"We expect it can be released soon, this year,\" he said.\nThe new rules may allow companies to proprose an extension 10 years before their contracts expire.\nFreeport said on Thursday it had been assured by the government of Indonesia that the contract for its Grasberg mine in the eastern province of Papua would be extended beyond 2021.\nThe government has been rolling out new measures to re-energise Southeast Asia's largest economy after growth cooled in the second quarter to 4.67 percent, the slowest pace in six years.\nPresident Joko Widodo has shown signs that the government is trying to mend fences with wary investors following a series of nationalistic policies by the previous administration.\nFreeport plans to invest $18 billion to transition the Grasberg complex from an open pit to underground mining in late 2017. The company currently produces about 220,000 tonnes of copper ore per day, which is then converted to copper concentrate.\nThe move on a contract extension comes after the U.S. miner previously reached agreements on higher royalties, an export tax and domestic processing and divestment.

A previous proposed contract was rejected by rank and file UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler in voting late last month.\nThe UAW Chrysler Council will meet in Detroit at 11 am/1600 GMT on Friday to discuss the agreement and vote on it, the union said.\nThe UAW had previously told the company that it would terminate the current labor contract if a new four-year contract deal was not reached by 11:59 pm EDT on Wednesday/0359 GMT on Thursday.\nThe company confirmed it had reached a tentative agreement but said it could not disclose details ahead of the UAW membership vote.\nA union spokesman gave no details of the talks including whether the company was willing to sweeten the deal it offered the UAW that was approved Sept. 18 by the union leaders but rejected last week by 65 percent of its rank-and-file Fiat Chrysler membership.\nWorkers have said they turned down the previous contract because many wanted a two-tier wage and benefit system eliminated. Short of that, they sought a cap on that lower-paid second tier at 25 percent of the total union workforce. Many workers also wish to undo some of the concessions they have given since 2007 to keep the company competitive.\nIf this agreement is ratified, the UAW will try to use the pact as a template for negotiations with the U.S. operations of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.

A previous proposed contract was rejected by rank and file UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler in voting late last month.\nThe UAW Chrysler Council will meet in Detroit at 11 am/1600 GMT on Friday to discuss the agreement and vote on it, the union said.\nThe UAW had previously told the company that it would terminate the current labor contract if a new four-year contract deal was not reached by 11:59 pm EDT on Wednesday/0359 GMT on Thursday.\nThe company confirmed it had reached a tentative agreement but said it could not disclose details ahead of the UAW membership vote.\nA union spokesman gave no details of the talks including whether the company was willing to sweeten the deal it offered the UAW that was approved Sept. 18 by the union leaders but rejected last week by 65 percent of its rank-and-file Fiat Chrysler membership.\nWorkers have said they turned down the previous contract because many wanted a two-tier wage and benefit system eliminated. Short of that, they sought a cap on that lower-paid second tier at 25 percent of the total union workforce. Many workers also wish to undo some of the concessions they have given since 2007 to keep the company competitive.\nIf this agreement is ratified, the UAW will try to use the pact as a template for negotiations with the U.S. operations of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.

In a full-year pre-close trading update for the financial year ended 30 September 2015, the specialty chemicals company said for the year as a whole, the value of its balanced portfolio helped to drive growth and overcome headwinds such as weaker sales in Oil & Gas, the effects of US Spine market consolidation on its Invibio medical business and a big hit from foreign exchange. \nOn a reported basis, full-year group revenue came in 4% ahead of last year at £263.5m, with fourth-quarter sales of £68.7m flat on the previous year. \nGroup sales volume, meanwhile, was up 19% from last year at 4,217 tonnes, reflecting overall momentum in VPS remaining positive during the fourth quarter, with growth across Aerospace, Automotive, General Industrial and strong Consumer Electronics volumes offsetting Oil & Gas. \nVictrex said Invibio performance in line with its previous guidance, with full-year revenue of £50.5m, down 5% from last year. \n\"Our overall growth momentum remains positive as we start our new financial year. Whilst we are mindful of the continuing weakness in Oil & Gas and the need to improve Invibio performance in 2016, our balanced portfolio keeps us well placed to continue driving growth and creating value, in line with our long term strategy.\" At 0817 BST, Victrex shares were 0.4% lower at 1,849p.",

Keytruda thereby met its main goal of the study.\nPatients whose tumors had especially high levels of PD-L1 also went longer without a progression of disease than those taking docetaxel, Merck said. Those whose tumors expressed PD-L1, but not at high levels, did not show such a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival.\nSafety of Keytruda was consistent with what had been seen in previous trials among lung cancer patients, Merck said in a release that included only summary \"topline\" information from the results.\nMore detailed data from the study will be provided soon, Merck said, adding that it will ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this year to add the new data to the drug's package insert label.\nU.S. regulators in October approved Keytruda on an accelerated basis for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors produce PD-L1. The approval was contingent on the company providing more detailed data in the future on Keytruda's safety and effectiveness.\nKeytruda and a similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient's own immune system to recognize and therefore attack the cancer.\nWall Street analysts expect cancer immunotherapies to earn combined annual sales of over $20 billion by 2020.

Those whose tumors expressed PD-L1, but not at high levels, did not show such a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival.\nSafety of Keytruda was consistent with what had been seen in previous trials among lung cancer patients, Merck said in a release that included only summary \"topline\" information from the results.\nMore detailed data from the study will be provided soon, Merck said, adding that it will ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this year to add the new data to the drug's package insert label.\nU.S. regulators in October approved Keytruda on an accelerated basis for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors produce PD-L1. The approval was contingent on the company providing more detailed data in the future on Keytruda's safety and effectiveness.\nKeytruda and a similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient's own immune system to recognize and therefore attack the cancer.\nWall Street analysts expect cancer immunotherapies to earn combined annual sales of over $20 billion by 2020.

        "text": "LONDON Oct 9 German Bund yields rose on Friday, with investors preferring stocks after minutes of the Federal Reserve meeting suggested that the U.S. central bank was not in a hurry to raise interest rates.\nA bounce in commodity and energy prices -- which have depressed bond yields recently by weakening the inflation outlook -- contributed to an increase in yields across the euro zone.\nThe minutes showed the Fed had thought the U.S. economy was close to warranting a rate hike, but decided it was prudent to wait for evidence that a global economic slowdown was not knocking the United States off course.\nMinutes from the European Central Bank's Sept. 2-3 policy meeting showed policymakers were warned of risks coming from emerging markets. Expectations for an extension of the ECB's trillion euro stimulus programme have grown in the past month.\nWhile loose monetary policy is usually supportive for bond prices, benchmark Bund yields have broken below 0.50 percent only once since June - for a few hours last week.\nMany in the bond market are wary after making losses on a rapid bounce in Bund yields from near-zero levels in May, a move that coincided with a brief uptick in inflation.\nWhen yields are so low, an increase of just a few basis points can cause major losses for investors as they lose the protection of coupon payments, which are close to zero as well.\nAs a result, instead of joining the rally in shares -- as they had done in the past when reacting to signs of more central bank stimulus -- bonds have been ditched in recent weeks during periods of higher risk appetite.\n\"Many are reluctant to buy German 10-year bonds at levels close to 50 basis points,\" said Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea. \"Still, as the ECB minutes yesterday reminded us, the central bank remains tilted towards further easing measures, which leaves bond yields with more downside potential.\"\nGerman 10-year Bund yields were up 2 basis points at 0.61 percent, a 10 basis point rise in a week in which below-forecast economic data strengthened the case for further monetary policy measures.\nStock markets were up across Europe, reflecting the increased risk appetite.

        "text_full": "Bund yields rise as dovish Fed minutes push investors towards stocks\nLONDON Oct 9 German Bund yields rose on Friday, with investors preferring stocks after minutes of the Federal Reserve meeting suggested that the U.S. central bank was not in a hurry to raise interest rates.\nA bounce in commodity and energy prices -- which have depressed bond yields recently by weakening the inflation outlook -- contributed to an increase in yields across the euro zone.\nThe minutes showed the Fed had thought the U.S. economy was close to warranting a rate hike, but decided it was prudent to wait for evidence that a global economic slowdown was not knocking the United States off course.\nMinutes from the European Central Bank's Sept. 2-3 policy meeting showed policymakers were warned of risks coming from emerging markets. Expectations for an extension of the ECB's trillion euro stimulus programme have grown in the past month.\nWhile loose monetary policy is usually supportive for bond prices, benchmark Bund yields have broken below 0.50 percent only once since June - for a few hours last week.\nMany in the bond market are wary after making losses on a rapid bounce in Bund yields from near-zero levels in May, a move that coincided with a brief uptick in inflation.\nWhen yields are so low, an increase of just a few basis points can cause major losses for investors as they lose the protection of coupon payments, which are close to zero as well.\nAs a result, instead of joining the rally in shares -- as they had done in the past when reacting to signs of more central bank stimulus -- bonds have been ditched in recent weeks during periods of higher risk appetite.\n\"Many are reluctant to buy German 10-year bonds at levels close to 50 basis points,\" said Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea. \"Still, as the ECB minutes yesterday reminded us, the central bank remains tilted towards further easing measures, which leaves bond yields with more downside potential.\"\nGerman 10-year Bund yields were up 2 basis points at 0.61 percent, a 10 basis point rise in a week in which below-forecast economic data strengthened the case for further monetary policy measures.\nStock markets were up across Europe, reflecting the increased risk appetite.

The company has allocated 200 million ringgit ($47 million) for capital expenditure for the next fiscal year, ending Aug 2016. \nTop Glove aims to grow its global market share to 30 percent in 2020 from 25 percent currently, the company has said previously. \nThe company has benefited from a strong U.S. dollar and weak commodities prices, and posted its highest-ever quarterly net profit during the June-August period. \nNet profit more than doubled to 103.1 million ringgit from 46.3 million ringgit in the same quarter a year earlier, while revenue rose 22.5 percent to 709.4 million ringgit. \n($1 = 4.2400 ringgit)",

The company has allocated 200 million ringgit ($47 million) for capital expenditure for the next fiscal year, ending Aug 2016. \nTop Glove aims to grow its global market share to 30 percent in 2020 from 25 percent currently, the company has said previously. \nThe company has benefited from a strong U.S. dollar and weak commodities prices, and posted its highest-ever quarterly net profit during the June-August period. \nNet profit more than doubled to 103.1 million ringgit from 46.3 million ringgit in the same quarter a year earlier, while revenue rose 22.5 percent to 709.4 million ringgit. \n($1 = 4.2400 ringgit)",

It bought 66.45 U.S. cents at 9:47 a.m. in Wellington from 66.65 cents immediately before the release.\nA majority of economists forecast the Reserve Bank will lower rates this month as economic growth slows and inflation remains below the 1 percent to 3 percent band that Wheeler targets. A report Friday will show consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in the year through September, according to the median forecast from a survey of economists by Bloomberg News.\nThe RBNZ “remains conscious of the impact that low interest rates can have on housing demand and its potential to feed into higher price inflation,” Wheeler said, indicating the issues that might moderate the push to lower rates. “It is important also to consider whether borrowing costs are constraining investment, and the need to have sufficient capacity to cut interest rates if the global economy slows significantly.”",

It bought 66.45 U.S. cents at 9:47 a.m. in Wellington from 66.65 cents immediately before the release.\nA majority of economists forecast the Reserve Bank will lower rates this month as economic growth slows and inflation remains below the 1 percent to 3 percent band that Wheeler targets. A report Friday will show consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in the year through September, according to the median forecast from a survey of economists by Bloomberg News.\nThe RBNZ “remains conscious of the impact that low interest rates can have on housing demand and its potential to feed into higher price inflation,” Wheeler said, indicating the issues that might moderate the push to lower rates. “It is important also to consider whether borrowing costs are constraining investment, and the need to have sufficient capacity to cut interest rates if the global economy slows significantly.”",

JPM attributed the downgrade to weaker industry trends and low visibility in trends. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the announcement on Wednesday highlighted three incremental concerns: lower-than-expected US community college enrolments, higher returns from US book retailers and lower-than-expected textbook sales in South Africa. \nThe bank cut its 2015 earnings per share estimate to 70p from 73.6p and its 2015 estimate to 63.3p from 71p. \n\"We expect a wide consensus earnings range for 2016, and think improving and consistent underlying growth trends are needed for the shares to outperform,\" it said. \nStill, the bank said the nine-month announcement from Pearson does not change its view regarding the potential long-term growth opportunity in education, including the potential for the company to sell more products/services to more customers. \nJPMorgan Cazenove upgraded Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) to 'overweight' from 'neutral' and lifted the price target to 35p from 30p following the company's announcement on Wednesday of a rights issue and debt restructuring. \n\"Lonmin disclosed a revised business plan and funding strategy with its full-year 2015 trading update that should see the group survive low platinum group metal prices over the ensuing three financial years at least, in our view. \n\"Essentially, the group must address a liquidity crunch to see it benefit from higher PGM prices we see from 2017.\" The bank said that assuming the proposed $400m rights issue is successful and the company secures amended debt facilities as planned, the stock is undervalued on its base-case numbers. \nJPM said key risks include lower-than-forecast PGM prices and failure to implement the new business plan, restructuring and proposed refinancing.",

JPM attributed the downgrade to weaker industry trends and low visibility in trends. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the announcement on Wednesday highlighted three incremental concerns: lower-than-expected US community college enrolments, higher returns from US book retailers and lower-than-expected textbook sales in South Africa. \nThe bank cut its 2015 earnings per share estimate to 70p from 73.6p and its 2015 estimate to 63.3p from 71p. \n\"We expect a wide consensus earnings range for 2016, and think improving and consistent underlying growth trends are needed for the shares to outperform,\" it said. \nStill, the bank said the nine-month announcement from Pearson does not change its view regarding the potential long-term growth opportunity in education, including the potential for the company to sell more products/services to more customers. \nJPMorgan Cazenove upgraded Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) to 'overweight' from 'neutral' and lifted the price target to 35p from 30p following the company's announcement on Wednesday of a rights issue and debt restructuring. \n\"Lonmin disclosed a revised business plan and funding strategy with its full-year 2015 trading update that should see the group survive low platinum group metal prices over the ensuing three financial years at least, in our view. \n\"Essentially, the group must address a liquidity crunch to see it benefit from higher PGM prices we see from 2017.\" The bank said that assuming the proposed $400m rights issue is successful and the company secures amended debt facilities as planned, the stock is undervalued on its base-case numbers. \nJPM said key risks include lower-than-forecast PGM prices and failure to implement the new business plan, restructuring and proposed refinancing.",

Through Thursday, the shares had advanced 6.8 percent in 2015.\nThe California Coastal Commission, which regulates construction activity along the state’s shoreline, approved the company’s plan to build an expanded habitat for killer whales at its San Diego theme park, SeaWorld said Friday in a statement. The commission attached conditions that included a ban on breeding the animals within the company’s facilities.\n“We are disappointed with the conditions they have placed on their approval,” Chief Executive Officer Joel Manby said in the statement. “Depriving these social animals of the natural and fundamental right to reproduce is inhumane and we do not support this condition.”\nSeaWorld Intraday Chart\nThe Orlando, Florida-based company has faced ongoing pressure from animal activists since the release of the 2013 documentary “Blackfish,” which argued that killer whales shouldn’t be kept in captivity. In August 2014, the company unveiled a plan to spend several hundred million dollars to expand the tanks at parks in California, Texas and Florida, in part to placate activists who say the whales don’t have enough room to swim, and turn angry because of the close quarters.\nThe San Diego enclosure was to open in 2018, the company said at the time. SeaWorld hasn’t broken ground on any of the new habitats, according to Fred Jacobs, a spokesman.",

        "text": "LOS ANGELES Oct 8 As makers of virtual reality content get ready to enter the mass market next year, one company is hoping to appeal to a broader audience outside of the tech set by harnessing fashion magazine InStyle's young female demographic.\nJaunt VR, which creates 360-degree virtual reality experiences, teamed up with Time Inc's InStyle to film its November issue cover shoot with actress Drew Barrymore. The short film experience will be available to the magazine's subscribers and smartphone users on Thursday.\nInStyle's audience is \"not the normal expected crowd people would think for VR,\" Scott Broock, Jaunt VR's vice president of content, told Reuters.\n\"People always think it's for male (video) gamers, but it's important, not just for us but for virtual reality as a whole, that people understand it's for everybody.\"\nVirtual reality is on the verge of mass market consumption as Facebook Inc-owned Oculus readies its Rift headset for consumers in early 2016.\nFacebook also recently launched 360-degree videos, allowing viewers to scroll around a video on a computer or smartphone, an early gateway into an interactive video experience. InStyle will upload a modified 360-degree video of the Barrymore shoot on Facebook and YouTube.\nSilicon Valley-based Jaunt VR, which last month raised $65 million in its latest round of funding from companies including Walt Disney Co, has also worked with Elle magazine and fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff.\nThis is the first time a U.S. magazine has created a virtual reality cover with a celebrity, InStyle said. In the film, Barrymore is seen posing for photographs and addressing the viewer in time-lapse.\nIt can be viewed through Jaunt VR's smartphone app for free using an inexpensive headset such as Google Inc's Cardboard viewer. InStyle will send out branded cardboard headsets to select subscribers and also offer 1,000 headsets online.\n\"You could have a VR experience with a phone and an inexpensive piece of equipment, and suddenly the technology becomes so much more democratic,\" said Angela Matusik, executive editor of digital at InStyle.

The short film experience will be available to the magazine's subscribers and smartphone users on Thursday.\nInStyle's audience is \"not the normal expected crowd people would think for VR,\" Scott Broock, Jaunt VR's vice president of content, told Reuters.\n\"People always think it's for male (video) gamers, but it's important, not just for us but for virtual reality as a whole, that people understand it's for everybody.\"\nVirtual reality is on the verge of mass market consumption as Facebook Inc-owned Oculus readies its Rift headset for consumers in early 2016.\nFacebook also recently launched 360-degree videos, allowing viewers to scroll around a video on a computer or smartphone, an early gateway into an interactive video experience. InStyle will upload a modified 360-degree video of the Barrymore shoot on Facebook and YouTube.\nSilicon Valley-based Jaunt VR, which last month raised $65 million in its latest round of funding from companies including Walt Disney Co, has also worked with Elle magazine and fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff.\nThis is the first time a U.S. magazine has created a virtual reality cover with a celebrity, InStyle said. In the film, Barrymore is seen posing for photographs and addressing the viewer in time-lapse.\nIt can be viewed through Jaunt VR's smartphone app for free using an inexpensive headset such as Google Inc's Cardboard viewer. InStyle will send out branded cardboard headsets to select subscribers and also offer 1,000 headsets online.\n\"You could have a VR experience with a phone and an inexpensive piece of equipment, and suddenly the technology becomes so much more democratic,\" said Angela Matusik, executive editor of digital at InStyle.

The company said the changes would reduce fourth quarter 2015 mine production by around 100,000 of contained zinc metal. \n\"The main reason for the reduction is to preserve the value of Glencore's reserves in the ground at a time of low zinc and lead prices, which do not correctly value the scarce nature of our resources,\" it said. \nOperations at Lady Loretta in Australia and Iscaycruz in Peru will be suspended, while operations at George Fisher and McArthur River, also in Australia, and several mine operations in Kazakhstan will cut output levels. \n\"Glencore remains positive about the medium and long term outlook for zinc, lead and silver prices.

        "text": "ATHENS Oct 8 Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' government comfortably won a confidence vote early on Thursday, starting a race to pass key reform laws before Athens undergoes a crucial first review of its international bailout.\nGreece has promised to implement the third bailout programme agreed with European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders in August in exchange for 86 billion euros. It wants the first review to be wrapped up soon so it can start talks on a debt relief before the end of the year.\n\"We will quickly pass the hurdle of the first review, we will conclude the big issues of the bank recapitalisation and the debt and we will proceed at a measured pace to change Greece,\" Tsipras said in a speech before the vote.\n\"I'm convinced that we will make it,\" he said adding that the government aims to conclude the review within November.\nTsipras, who was re-elected on Sept. 20, won the backing of all 155 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament who support his radical left-right coalition.\nHis parliamentary group will be tested in the coming weeks during votes on reforms, tax hikes and pension cuts that Greece must enact to qualify for 3 billion euros of bailout aid and to unlock 25 billion euros to recapitalise its banks.\nThe first set of 48 reforms needs to be turned into law by Oct. 15.\nThe leftist premier has promised to find ways to ease the social pain that the bailout will entail for the poorest Greeks and has vowed to find alternative measures for some of the unpopular policies sought by creditors.\nHe has also said he will bargain hard for debt relief.\nTsipras needs the debt restructuring to convince Greeks after seven years of economic hardship that he achieved something in return for performing a spectacular U-turn and accepting austerity conditions he had rejected in June.

        "text_full": "Greek government wins confidence vote before first bailout review\nATHENS Oct 8 Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' government comfortably won a confidence vote early on Thursday, starting a race to pass key reform laws before Athens undergoes a crucial first review of its international bailout.\nGreece has promised to implement the third bailout programme agreed with European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders in August in exchange for 86 billion euros. It wants the first review to be wrapped up soon so it can start talks on a debt relief before the end of the year.\n\"We will quickly pass the hurdle of the first review, we will conclude the big issues of the bank recapitalisation and the debt and we will proceed at a measured pace to change Greece,\" Tsipras said in a speech before the vote.\n\"I'm convinced that we will make it,\" he said adding that the government aims to conclude the review within November.\nTsipras, who was re-elected on Sept. 20, won the backing of all 155 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament who support his radical left-right coalition.\nHis parliamentary group will be tested in the coming weeks during votes on reforms, tax hikes and pension cuts that Greece must enact to qualify for 3 billion euros of bailout aid and to unlock 25 billion euros to recapitalise its banks.\nThe first set of 48 reforms needs to be turned into law by Oct. 15.\nThe leftist premier has promised to find ways to ease the social pain that the bailout will entail for the poorest Greeks and has vowed to find alternative measures for some of the unpopular policies sought by creditors.\nHe has also said he will bargain hard for debt relief.\nTsipras needs the debt restructuring to convince Greeks after seven years of economic hardship that he achieved something in return for performing a spectacular U-turn and accepting austerity conditions he had rejected in June.

The deal has since been endorsed by money managers including from Pioneer Investments and Aberdeen Asset Management Plc.\n\"It’s a done deal,\" said Gintaras Shlizhyus, a Vienna-based strategist at Raiffeisen Bank International AG. \"The agreement on the shorter maturities has substantially decreased the possibility of holdouts.\"\nPassing the deal without holdouts will help the war-ravaged country meet its obligations under a $17.5 billion International Monetary Fund loan that requires a reduction to its external debt burden. The terms include a 20 percent writedown to the principal value of the bonds, higher average interest payments and warrants tied to gross domestic product growth.\nFor the bonds to be restructured, 75 percent of the investors need to vote in favor at next week’s meeting in which two thirds of the creditors are represented. If quorum isn’t met at a first meeting, a second meeting can be called after two weeks.",

Economists, commentators and even Federal Reserve researchers have spilled a lot of ink debating whether the decline in participation decline is a short-term, \"cyclical\" aftershock of the economic downturn, or if it signals a more permanent, \"structural\" shift in the economy.\nGoldman economists are coming around to the latter idea. Workforce participation among older workers is picking up more slowly than they had initially projected and discouraged workers entering the workforce are providing less of a boost, according to an Oct. 10 research note.\nThe trend will cause the participation rate to fall by about a quarter percentage-point annually in coming years, and since people not looking for work aren&apos;t counted as unemployed, the jobless rate will drop below 4.5 percent in 2018 from its current 5.1 percent, Goldman&apos;s team says.\nThe economists now expect that the \"participation gap\" — people who are out of the labor force but who might come back in — accounts for 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent of the population. That&apos;s a small portion of the big drop since 2007, suggesting that some of the decline, \"though originally cyclical, eventually became structural in nature.\"\n\"The downward revision to our participation forecast has directionally hawkish implications for monetary policy,\" writes David Mericle, a New York-based economist at Goldman. \"Nevertheless, it is also worth keeping in mind that our results still show a considerable amount of remaining labor market slack, which is consistent with the continued softness of wage and price inflation.\"",

The newspaper did not specify which asset classes might be sold.\nIt said the size of the sales was expected to be about 9 billion dinars ($30 billion), as officials believed selling assets with returns of below 9 percent would be a relatively cheap method of covering the budget deficit and financing big infrastructure projects that are being planned.\nThe KIA did not respond to calls and an email seeking comment on Sunday. Some other Gulf states, principally Saudi Arabia, have already begun liquidating assets to cover their deficits in an era of cheap oil.\nAlthough Kuwait is one of the wealthiest oil exporters in the Gulf and is in no financial danger, state revenues have been hit hard this year by low oil prices.\nThe government ran a deficit of 1.094 billion dinars in the first five months of the fiscal year which started in April, after a deduction for the Future Generations Fund, which is part of its sovereign fund.\nFinance minister Anas al-Saleh said last month that the government also planned to sell local currency bonds by the end of this year to help cover its deficit.

To do that you need a good education system,\" Snyder told reporters at a briefing in the state capital of Lansing.\nThe plan calls for transferring the school system's 47,000 students, its employees and their benefits, contracts and assets to a new Detroit Community School District. The current Detroit Public Schools would remain in existence until an operating deficit, expected to be $515 million next June, is eliminated over several years using local property tax revenue.\nMichigan would replace the school system's tax revenue dedicated to the deficit elimination with state funding going to the new school operating entity. That entity would need an additional $200 million to cover capital and other costs, bringing the total state contribution to $715 million, according to a Snyder\nA property tax levy earmarked for the district's outstanding bonds would continue to pay off that debt, said spokeswoman Sara Wurfel.\nThe Detroit Financial Review Commission, which was created as part of the city's bankruptcy exit plan, would oversee the finances of both school entities until the deficit is erased.\nSnyder's proposal also creates an initially appointed school board that will transition to an elected board, as well as a Detroit Education Commission to oversee the hiring of a new chief education officer. That official would be tasked with creating a plan to boost the district's sagging enrollment and its academic performance. (Reporting by Karen Pierog ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",

That entity would need an additional $200 million to cover capital and other costs, bringing the total state contribution to $715 million, according to a Snyder\nA property tax levy earmarked for the district's outstanding bonds would continue to pay off that debt, said spokeswoman Sara Wurfel.\nThe Detroit Financial Review Commission, which was created as part of the city's bankruptcy exit plan, would oversee the finances of both school entities until the deficit is erased.\nSnyder's proposal also creates an initially appointed school board that will transition to an elected board, as well as a Detroit Education Commission to oversee the hiring of a new chief education officer. That official would be tasked with creating a plan to boost the district's sagging enrollment and its academic performance. (Reporting by Karen Pierog ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",

Sky News said advisers to the company are targeting the latter half of next week to announce its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) . \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) cited sources as saying that McCarthy, which has attracted interest from buyout firm Bridgepoint, would likely look to raise around £100m from the issue of new shares in an initial public offering, with existing investors also selling part of their holdings. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the numbers and timings are not yet finalised and could still change. \nLast week, McCarthy & Stone reported a 40% increase in underlying pre-tax profit for the year to the end of August and said it would expand a target for land investment and building over the next four financial years. \nMcCarthy and its peers have been boosted by plans announced over the summer for a relaxation of planning rules to enable thousands of new homes to be built on brownfield sites across the UK.",

Sky News said advisers to the company are targeting the latter half of next week to announce its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) . \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) cited sources as saying that McCarthy, which has attracted interest from buyout firm Bridgepoint, would likely look to raise around £100m from the issue of new shares in an initial public offering, with existing investors also selling part of their holdings. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the numbers and timings are not yet finalised and could still change. \nLast week, McCarthy & Stone reported a 40% increase in underlying pre-tax profit for the year to the end of August and said it would expand a target for land investment and building over the next four financial years. \nMcCarthy and its peers have been boosted by plans announced over the summer for a relaxation of planning rules to enable thousands of new homes to be built on brownfield sites across the UK.",
