Most of our product pipelines are ruptured and attacked frequently,\" Emmauel Ibe Kachikwu, head of the National Nigerian Petroleum Corp, said in an emailed statement. \nThe reason for the deadline was not immediately clear. \nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said that about 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude is stolen in Nigeria, which produces just over 2 million bpd of oil. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is used in hundreds of illegal refineries and even for export. Gas pipelines dependent on crude flows are sometimes forced to close and are even tapped by mistake by those looking for oil, which in turn disrupts electricity production. \nMeanwhile, the infrastructure delivering crude to Nigeria's refining system became so degraded that the state oil company was forced into expensive supply contracts by sea. \n\"We are launching an armada of approaches, which will include the incorporation of drones to check movements of vessels within our territorial waters,\" Kachikwu said. \nThe country has limited and poorly maintained drones. Those purchased from an Israeli firm several years ago and that might have been used in the fight against the Islamist insurgency in the northeast of the country have become grounded. \nKachikwu said the \"logistical nightmares\" of staff changes at the crude export terminals would also be examined and that the navy would be better equipped to run patrols in the area. \n\"The best security for these pipelines lies with the communities. We are trying to create enough incentives for them to see these pipelines as their own,\" Kachikwu said. \nUnder former president Goodluck Jonathan, ex-delta militants that attacked oil installations in the early 2000s were given pipeline protection contracts after an amnesty, but theft continued to grow and spiked ahead of March's election.

        "text_full": "Nigeria must eradicate oil theft in eight months-NNPC\n0.0001 0.0000 \nABUJA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Nigerian authorities hope to put an end to rampant oil theft in eight months by increasing drone and naval monitoring of territorial waters and working with local communities, the state oil company chief said on Tuesday. \nThe Niger delta has been plagued by oil theft for years that has left the region heavily polluted and prompted foreign oil companies, particularly Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) , to sell onshore assets. \n\"We must eradicate oil theft in eight months ... Most of our product pipelines are ruptured and attacked frequently,\" Emmauel Ibe Kachikwu, head of the National Nigerian Petroleum Corp, said in an emailed statement. \nThe reason for the deadline was not immediately clear. \nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said that about 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude is stolen in Nigeria, which produces just over 2 million bpd of oil. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is used in hundreds of illegal refineries and even for export. Gas pipelines dependent on crude flows are sometimes forced to close and are even tapped by mistake by those looking for oil, which in turn disrupts electricity production. \nMeanwhile, the infrastructure delivering crude to Nigeria's refining system became so degraded that the state oil company was forced into expensive supply contracts by sea. \n\"We are launching an armada of approaches, which will include the incorporation of drones to check movements of vessels within our territorial waters,\" Kachikwu said. \nThe country has limited and poorly maintained drones. Those purchased from an Israeli firm several years ago and that might have been used in the fight against the Islamist insurgency in the northeast of the country have become grounded. \nKachikwu said the \"logistical nightmares\" of staff changes at the crude export terminals would also be examined and that the navy would be better equipped to run patrols in the area. \n\"The best security for these pipelines lies with the communities. We are trying to create enough incentives for them to see these pipelines as their own,\" Kachikwu said. \nUnder former president Goodluck Jonathan, ex-delta militants that attacked oil installations in the early 2000s were given pipeline protection contracts after an amnesty, but theft continued to grow and spiked ahead of March's election.

The cuts will be announced as early as Monday, according to several reports.\nEarlier, daily Estado de S.Paulo reported that Rousseff had decided to cut at least 15 billion reais of next year's budget, which was sent to Congress with a deficit of about 30 billion reais.\nFolha, which tends to lean center-right, said deep budget cuts are needed for the government to gain credibility before demanding more tax hikes that will face strong popular opposition.\n\"The country, however, has no choice\" but to accept higher taxes, Folha said. \"Neither has President Dilma Rousseff: if she bends under the weight of the crisis, she will have no option other than leaving her presidential duties and, eventually, the position she holds.\"\nFolha also called for an end to some pension benefits and economic subsidies, as well as temporary cuts in health and education programs that are currently mandatory.\nA spokeswoman for Rousseff declined to comment on the editorial.\n($1 = 3.87 reais) (Reporting by Walter Brandimarte ; Editing by Paul Simao and Bill Trott)",

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.\nTHE GLOBE AND MAIL\n** The Bank of Montreal has agreed to buy GE Capital's transportation finance business, boosting the Canadian lender's U.S. commercial banking business and adding one more Canadian name to the list of buyers for GE Capital's assets. ( bit.ly/1JZRJ3r )\n** Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservatives are retooling their election campaign after a series of missteps that has driven the Tories to third place in the polls. The changes come as his government scrambles to unveil a plan within days that speeds up Canada's intake of Syrian refugees.

The Federation of Small Businesses recently reported that credit availability for small businesses had increased. \nThe biggest declines in lending to small firms came at Nationwide Building Society (LSE: CCDS.L - news ) and Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) . Nationwide's lending to small firms contracted by 279 million pounds, and RBS's lending fell by 266 million. \n($1 = 0.6532 pounds) (Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Steve Slater and David Holmes)",

The Federation of Small Businesses recently reported that credit availability for small businesses had increased. \nThe biggest declines in lending to small firms came at Nationwide Building Society (LSE: CCDS.L - news ) and Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) . Nationwide's lending to small firms contracted by 279 million pounds, and RBS's lending fell by 266 million. \n($1 = 0.6532 pounds) (Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Steve Slater and David Holmes)",

        "text": "Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan said he wants the U.K. bank to buy back shares to help reduce the government’s stake.\n“I would rather participate as the government is selling down,” McEwan, 58, told investors at a conference in London on Tuesday. “It’s probably the best thing for all investors, where excess capital goes back through buybacks.”\nChancellor George Osborne raised 2.1 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) selling the first portion of RBS shares in August, even though it came at a loss on Britain’s bailout of the Edinburgh-based lender at the height of the financial crisis. McEwan plans to return capital to shareholders from early 2017, using funds generated from asset disposals as the bank focuses on U.K. and Irish consumer lending.\nMcEwan said RBS could follow American International Group Inc., which bought shares to help cut the U.S. government’s stake after requiring a bailout in 2008. The U.K. owns 72.9 percent of RBS.\n“You’ve seen very good examples of that in the marketplace,” McEwan said. “AIG did the same, where the government sold out, and that worked very successfully for all parties.”\nRBS shares gained as much as 1.9 percent as other major U.K. lenders declined. The stock was up 0.6 percent to 311.3 pence at 10:45 a.m. in London trading for a loss of 21 percent this year.\nThe CEO said RBS is on-course to reduce costs by about 850 million pounds in 2015. That would exceed a target given in July by 50 million pounds because of the bank levy, according to McEwan. The bank is “on-track to deliver” all of its targets and is making “great progress” reducing assets, he added.",

        "text_full": "RBS CEO Seeking to Buy Back Government Shares to Cut U.K. Stake\nRoyal Bank of Scotland Group Plc Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan said he wants the U.K. bank to buy back shares to help reduce the government’s stake.\n“I would rather participate as the government is selling down,” McEwan, 58, told investors at a conference in London on Tuesday. “It’s probably the best thing for all investors, where excess capital goes back through buybacks.”\nChancellor George Osborne raised 2.1 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) selling the first portion of RBS shares in August, even though it came at a loss on Britain’s bailout of the Edinburgh-based lender at the height of the financial crisis. McEwan plans to return capital to shareholders from early 2017, using funds generated from asset disposals as the bank focuses on U.K. and Irish consumer lending.\nMcEwan said RBS could follow American International Group Inc., which bought shares to help cut the U.S. government’s stake after requiring a bailout in 2008. The U.K. owns 72.9 percent of RBS.\n“You’ve seen very good examples of that in the marketplace,” McEwan said. “AIG did the same, where the government sold out, and that worked very successfully for all parties.”\nRBS shares gained as much as 1.9 percent as other major U.K. lenders declined. The stock was up 0.6 percent to 311.3 pence at 10:45 a.m. in London trading for a loss of 21 percent this year.\nThe CEO said RBS is on-course to reduce costs by about 850 million pounds in 2015. That would exceed a target given in July by 50 million pounds because of the bank levy, according to McEwan. The bank is “on-track to deliver” all of its targets and is making “great progress” reducing assets, he added.",

Learn more... \nTue, Sep 1, 2015, 21:03 BST - UK Markets closed Nigeria's oil company says to deploy drones to fight theft AFP – 24 minutes ago View Photo \n\nNigeria's state oil giant NNPC announced Tuesday a plan to deploy drones to monitor the movement of ships in a bid to fight oil theft on the nation's waterways. \nThe managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Ibe Kachikwu, made the disclosure at a special conference on security in the Gulf of Guinea. \n\"We are launching an armada of approaches which will include incorporation of drones to check movements of vessels within our territorial waters,\" he said, according to an NNPC official statement. \n\"We are looking at the current logistical nightmares of changing staffing at the loading bay of crude oil export terminals virtually every 90 days\", he added. \nKachikwu said NNPC was also trying to help the Nigerian navy make up for a lack of equipment to carry out patrols. \nThe moves are expected to end theft within the next eight months, the NNPC statement added. \nKachikwu said that if oil theft was left unchecked, it could make it impossible for NNPC to operate the nation's four refineries. \nHe said that between June 2014 and June 2015 nearly 4,000 attacks were made on its pipelines across the country, and that a total of 350 people including NNPC workers, policemen, local community members had been killed by oil thieves in the past three years. \nNigeria will seek the support of the international community, especially from countries that receive the stolen cargoes, as part of the crackdown on oil theft. \nOil accounts for more than 90 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings. \nSpeaking at the conference, Sao Tome prime minister Patrice Emery Trovoada urged countries in the Gulf of Guinea to forge better collaboration to improve maritime security.",

        "text": "Don’t expect China’s sale of billions of dollars of U.S. Treasuries to drive yields higher -- at least not right away -- says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nChina’s central bank has been buying yuan and selling dollar assets to support the exchange rate since the shock devaluation of its currency last month. While the nation won’t disclose its latest holdings until Sept. 7, Societe Generale SA estimated the People’s Bank of China has offloaded at least $100 billion of its $3.7 trillion trove of reserve assets since the currency regime change on Aug. 11, including Treasuries.\nBut the impact of China’s selling isn’t so straightforward, Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of macro and markets research at Goldman Sachs in London, wrote in a report Wednesday. Changes in the global economic outlook typically trump money flows in determining the direction of bond yields. With the world’s second-biggest economy slowing and global markets in turmoil, China’s reduction of Treasuries is partly offset by investors parking cash in fixed-income assets, he wrote.\n“We would advise against following a narrow flow-of-funds approach,” Garzarelli said in the report. “Shifts in macro expectations tend to win the day.”\nOn a longer-term basis, the decline in reserves by China and other central banks, which together hold $11.4 trillion of assets, will hurt dollar-denominated bonds as private investors eventually rotate out of debt and into riskier assets, Garzarelli said.\nChina, with $1.27 trillion of Treasuries as of June, is the biggest overseas holder. If the International Monetary Fund’s aggregation of international reserve assets is any guide, around two-thirds of the nation’s war chest is in dollars.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.15 percent Wednesday, up from as low as 1.9 percent last month. Goldman Sachs forecasts yields will end the year at 2.5 percent, still well below the 3 percent where their model of fair value, which is based on macroeconomic fundamentals, says it should trade.",

        "text_full": "Goldman Says China Burning Reserves No Big Deal for Treasuries\nDon’t expect China’s sale of billions of dollars of U.S. Treasuries to drive yields higher -- at least not right away -- says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nChina’s central bank has been buying yuan and selling dollar assets to support the exchange rate since the shock devaluation of its currency last month. While the nation won’t disclose its latest holdings until Sept. 7, Societe Generale SA estimated the People’s Bank of China has offloaded at least $100 billion of its $3.7 trillion trove of reserve assets since the currency regime change on Aug. 11, including Treasuries.\nBut the impact of China’s selling isn’t so straightforward, Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of macro and markets research at Goldman Sachs in London, wrote in a report Wednesday. Changes in the global economic outlook typically trump money flows in determining the direction of bond yields. With the world’s second-biggest economy slowing and global markets in turmoil, China’s reduction of Treasuries is partly offset by investors parking cash in fixed-income assets, he wrote.\n“We would advise against following a narrow flow-of-funds approach,” Garzarelli said in the report. “Shifts in macro expectations tend to win the day.”\nOn a longer-term basis, the decline in reserves by China and other central banks, which together hold $11.4 trillion of assets, will hurt dollar-denominated bonds as private investors eventually rotate out of debt and into riskier assets, Garzarelli said.\nChina, with $1.27 trillion of Treasuries as of June, is the biggest overseas holder. If the International Monetary Fund’s aggregation of international reserve assets is any guide, around two-thirds of the nation’s war chest is in dollars.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.15 percent Wednesday, up from as low as 1.9 percent last month. Goldman Sachs forecasts yields will end the year at 2.5 percent, still well below the 3 percent where their model of fair value, which is based on macroeconomic fundamentals, says it should trade.",

Learn more... \nTue, Sep 1, 2015, 11:19 BST - UK Markets close in 5 hrs 11 mins Forum Energy Technologies Signs Contract for Eight Edge™ II Desalters Press Release : Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. – 19 minutes ago +0.93 \nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \nForum Energy Technologies, Inc. (FET) is pleased to announce the signing of a contract with Egyptian Refining Company (ERC) to engineer, design and build eight Edge™ II desalters. The desalters will be utilized in the Cairo Oil Refinery Company’s expansion project near Cairo. The units are scheduled for completion April 2016 and have a contract value of more than $20 million. \nForum’s proprietary Edge II technology has been used in many refineries around the world and maximizes desalting performance and feedstock capacity while minimizing demulsifier and solids-wetting chemicals of most chemical suppliers. The desalters also utilize Forum’s Kick Amp Responder (KAR) technology. KAR allows operators to achieve better optimization and efficiency by controlling the output voltage of any crude or desalting coalescing operation using the existing electrostatic setup. \nAbout Forum Energy Technologies \nForum Energy Technologies is a global oilfield products company, serving the subsea, drilling, completion, production and infrastructure sectors of the oil and natural gas industry. Forum’s products include highly engineered capital equipment as well as products that are consumed in the drilling, well construction, production and transportation of oil and natural gas. Forum is headquartered in Houston, TX with manufacturing and distribution facilities strategically located around the globe. For more information, please visit www.f-e-t.com .

He was arrested early August in his home, where he already was under house arrest serving an 11-year sentence for his involvement in a cash-for-votes scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago. \nProsecutors have said that Dirceu masterminded the kickback scheme at Petrobras, accepted bribes while in office and continued to receive payments from contractors after he was jailed in late 2013 for the vote-buying scandal. \nAccording to prosecutors, the scheme at Petrobras involved roughly $2 billion in bribes and other illegal funds. Some of that money was allegedly funneled back to campaign coffers of the ruling party and its allies. It also allegedly included the payment of bribes to Petrobras executives in return for inflated contracts.",

        "text": "Global investment banks may see revenue drop 19 percent in the third quarter, lowering earnings per shares across the industry, as a surge in volatility caused by turmoil in China recedes, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n“Recent strong turnover, especially in equities, could decline materially once markets settle -- not just in Asia but globally,” analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a report on Thursday. “Although volatility is good for investment banks,” it “could impact deal completion in the third quarter and potentially the fourth quarter,” they wrote, when cutting their estimates for earnings-per-share by an average of 2 percent to 3 percent through 2017.\nChina has roiled markets around the world in the past two months after poor economic data fed fears its economy is slowing more than expected, leading to a crash in domestic shares that wiped out almost $4 trillion of value. The country also staged a shock devaluation of the yuan and intervened in the stock market. China is now shutting down its exchanges and banks until Monday to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Japan’s World War II defeat, giving investors and bankers four days of respite.\nAt the world’s top investment banks, excluding Goldman Sachs Group Inc., revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities trading will fall 18 percent in the third quarter from the second instead of a previously projected 14 percent, with “currencies expected to be the best-performing asset class followed by rates and credit,” the analysts wrote. Revenue from equities trading may drop 20 percent in that period instead of 16 percent, according to the note.\nAt UBS Group AG, analysts’ top pick of the global trading and advisory firms, earnings per share will be 3 percent lower on average through 2016, driven by lower equity and corporate advisory revenues, according to the report. At Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, estimates for earnings per share were also cut by 3 percent for 2015, with with Deutsche Bank AG’s and Barclays Plc’s forecasts down 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively.\n“We prefer cash equity and macro geared investment banks,” the analysts wrote in the report, when citing UBS and Deutsche Bank.",

The country also staged a shock devaluation of the yuan and intervened in the stock market. China is now shutting down its exchanges and banks until Monday to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Japan’s World War II defeat, giving investors and bankers four days of respite.\nAt the world’s top investment banks, excluding Goldman Sachs Group Inc., revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities trading will fall 18 percent in the third quarter from the second instead of a previously projected 14 percent, with “currencies expected to be the best-performing asset class followed by rates and credit,” the analysts wrote. Revenue from equities trading may drop 20 percent in that period instead of 16 percent, according to the note.\nAt UBS Group AG, analysts’ top pick of the global trading and advisory firms, earnings per share will be 3 percent lower on average through 2016, driven by lower equity and corporate advisory revenues, according to the report. At Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, estimates for earnings per share were also cut by 3 percent for 2015, with with Deutsche Bank AG’s and Barclays Plc’s forecasts down 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively.\n“We prefer cash equity and macro geared investment banks,” the analysts wrote in the report, when citing UBS and Deutsche Bank.",

It has said it was anticipating consolidation in the crop chemicals and seeds industry and it also has costly drug development and marketing campaigns to fund.

It has said it was anticipating consolidation in the crop chemicals and seeds industry and it also has costly drug development and marketing campaigns to fund.

Learn more... \nWed, Sep 2, 2015, 10:32 BST - UK Markets close in 5 hrs 58 mins Spanish jobless claims rise for first time in 7 months AFP – 12 minutes ago View Photo \n\nSpain registered in August its first a increase in jobless claims in seven months, data showed Wednesday, but with elections just months away the government dismissed it as a seasonal uptick that does not wipe away improvements over the past year. \nJobless claims increased last month by 21,679, or 0.54 percent, to 4.07 million, the labour ministry said in a statement. \nAugust is traditionally weak for the Spanish jobs market as hotels and restaurants cut back on staff as the busy summer tourism season comes to an end. \nThe number of people without work rose mainly in the services sector, with increases also in manufacturing and in the construction, but declined in the agriculture sector as the harvest season began. \nHowever the number of registered unemployed was down by 359,975 or 8.1 percent over August 2014, the biggest annual decline ever registered during the month of August, the labour ministry said. \nConservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is betting on an improved economy to give him a boost as he prepares for what promises to be a hard-fought re-election campaign at the end of the year. \nSecretary of state for employment, Juan Pablo Riesgo, said the latest unemployment figures \"confirm the improvement of the Spanish labour market.\" \n\"Unemployment continues to fall, if one does not take into account the seasonal component, and the important rhythm of the fall in unemployment has been maintained this year,\" he added. \nThe labour ministry's monthly figure is a different measure from the quarterly unemployment rate, which is based on surveys and stood at 22.4 percent in the second quarter, according to the National Statistic Institute. \nSpain emerged in 2013 from five years of on-off recession. The government forecasts the economy to grow 3.3 percent this year -- more than twice the average growth rate forecast for eurozone countries (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

Learn more... \nWed, Sep 2, 2015, 10:32 BST - UK Markets close in 5 hrs 58 mins Spanish jobless claims rise for first time in 7 months AFP – 12 minutes ago View Photo \n\nSpain registered in August its first a increase in jobless claims in seven months, data showed Wednesday, but with elections just months away the government dismissed it as a seasonal uptick that does not wipe away improvements over the past year. \nJobless claims increased last month by 21,679, or 0.54 percent, to 4.07 million, the labour ministry said in a statement. \nAugust is traditionally weak for the Spanish jobs market as hotels and restaurants cut back on staff as the busy summer tourism season comes to an end. \nThe number of people without work rose mainly in the services sector, with increases also in manufacturing and in the construction, but declined in the agriculture sector as the harvest season began. \nHowever the number of registered unemployed was down by 359,975 or 8.1 percent over August 2014, the biggest annual decline ever registered during the month of August, the labour ministry said. \nConservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is betting on an improved economy to give him a boost as he prepares for what promises to be a hard-fought re-election campaign at the end of the year. \nSecretary of state for employment, Juan Pablo Riesgo, said the latest unemployment figures \"confirm the improvement of the Spanish labour market.\" \n\"Unemployment continues to fall, if one does not take into account the seasonal component, and the important rhythm of the fall in unemployment has been maintained this year,\" he added. \nThe labour ministry's monthly figure is a different measure from the quarterly unemployment rate, which is based on surveys and stood at 22.4 percent in the second quarter, according to the National Statistic Institute. \nSpain emerged in 2013 from five years of on-off recession. The government forecasts the economy to grow 3.3 percent this year -- more than twice the average growth rate forecast for eurozone countries (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

Mortgage approvals have risen in five of the last seven months and the pace of price rises has picked up. \nNet mortgage lending, which lags approvals, surged by 2.709 billion pounds in July, the biggest increase since July 2008. \nThe BoE said consumer credit grew by 1.173 billion pounds in July, down slightly from a 1.23 billion pound rise in June. But it was up 7.5 percent on an annual basis -- the biggest such increase since April 2006. \nDespite only weak rises in wages for much of the past five years, Britain's economic recovery is still heavily reliant on spending by households. \nThe BoE said lending to non-financial businesses rose 734 million pounds, after a 5.48 billion pound dip in June. \n(Reporting by Andy Bruce and Ana Nicolaci Da Costa)",

Mortgage approvals have risen in five of the last seven months and the pace of price rises has picked up. \nNet mortgage lending, which lags approvals, surged by 2.709 billion pounds in July, the biggest increase since July 2008. \nThe BoE said consumer credit grew by 1.173 billion pounds in July, down slightly from a 1.23 billion pound rise in June. But it was up 7.5 percent on an annual basis -- the biggest such increase since April 2006. \nDespite only weak rises in wages for much of the past five years, Britain's economic recovery is still heavily reliant on spending by households. \nThe BoE said lending to non-financial businesses rose 734 million pounds, after a 5.48 billion pound dip in June. \n(Reporting by Andy Bruce and Ana Nicolaci Da Costa)",

The talks cover a 50-million euro ($56 million) facility agreed to in April 2014.\nQuick’s debt ratio rose to 6.4 times at the end of June, the people said, as the company contends with competition from McDonald’s Corp., Burger King Worldwide Inc. and so-called casual-dining chains. Failure to get new terms for the credit facility could affect Quick’s 595 million euros of bonds sold in April 2014.\nA spokesman for French state investment fund Qualium Investissement, owner of Quick, declined to comment on the debt talks. A spokeswoman for Quick said she couldn’t immediately comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.\nQuick’s management is seeking to sell some restaurants to reduce debt, the people said. Debtwire reported on the debt talks earlier.\nThe fast-food company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell by about 10 million euros to 90 million euros in the 12 months ended June, the people said. The chain passed the June covenant test as the net debt-to-earnings ratio cap was 7.5 times. This will tighten in December.\nPrivate-equity funds TDR Capital and Oaktree Capital Management were among investors considering buying Quick in July, people familiar with the matter said at the time.\nQuick’s 440 million euros of first lien bonds due April 2019 are Quote: d at 84.3 cents on the euro, near the record low, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

My apologies to the Parisians, but the farmers are coming.\" \nDuring the summer, protesting farmers around the country dumped manure in cities, blocked access to roads and motorways and prevented tourists from reaching the popular Mont St-Michel in northern France. \nIn the latest protest, tractors from all over France have for a week been converging on Paris at an average speed of 35 kilometres per hour (22 miles per hour). \nPolice have asked \"drivers to postpone their trips\" into the capital on Thursday and to take public transport, as traffic is expected to be severely disrupted. \nFarmers' unions have been negotiating with the government, which unveiled an emergency package worth 600 million euros ($680 million) in tax relief and loan guarantees in July. \nBut they say this is woefully inadequate, as tales of farms going under -- and in the most extreme cases of suicides -- hit the news. \nThe agriculture minister has estimated that around 10 percent of farms in France -- approximately 22,000 sites -- are on the brink of bankruptcy with a combined debt of one billion euros. \nA delegation of some 100 farmers will go to France's lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, Thursday to hand over to lawmakers \"the demands and grievances of an agricultural and rural world that is on the brink of exploding and that expects a lot from its national representatives (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) \".",

        "text": "CHICAGO, Sept 2 The Illinois House on Wednesday failed to override Governor Bruce Rauner's veto of a controversial bill to send collective bargaining impasses to arbitration, leaving open the possibility of a future strike or lockout of state workers.\nThe Democrat-controlled House fell three votes short of the 71 needed to make the bill law after the Senate, which also has a Democratic majority, overrode Rauner's veto last month.\nDemocratic lawmakers and the Republican governor have been locked in a struggle over a state budget and an agenda pushed by Rauner that includes legislative term limits and collective bargaining curbs. Illinois this week entered its third month without a budget for the fiscal year that started July 1.\nHouse Speaker Michael Madigan told reporters after the vote that the bill was meant to buy labor peace by prohibiting strikes or lockouts. He also noted that Rauner \"did talk in terms of the possibility of a government shutdown in order to achieve his goals.\"\nRauner had condemned the bill as an attempt to take away his power to negotiate worker contracts at a time the state is strapped for cash.\n\"It is encouraging that many legislators recognized the dire financial impact this legislation would have had on our state,\" the governor said in a statement.\nHe added that he hoped \"serious negotiations\" can begin on structural reforms and a balanced budget. Madigan also expressed hope that differences could be resolved, but Democrats are unlikely to embrace items on Rauner's agenda that would hurt unions or impair their party's power.\nThe state's biggest public labor union, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31, said Rauner's attack on the arbitration bill \"has now derailed the best hope of amicably settling union contracts that are fair to all.\"\nWhile the contract expired June 30, the union, which represents 38,000 state workers, and the state have an agreement that expires Sept. 30 not to strike or lockout workers while negotiations continue.

It fell short of the forecast 52.6, according to a Reuters poll of economists.\nFed fund futures for 2016 delivery added to earlier gains following the latest ISM U.S. factory report. They were mostly up 0.5 to 4.0 basis points from Monday's close.\nThe 2015 fed funds contracts were flat, suggesting little change in the view among traders on timing whether the Fed would raise interest rates by year-end.\nThe Dec fed funds contract implied traders see a 60 percent of a rate hike in December, little changed from Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.\n(Reporting by Richard Leong ; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )",

It fell short of the forecast 52.6, according to a Reuters poll of economists.\nFed fund futures for 2016 delivery added to earlier gains following the latest ISM U.S. factory report. They were mostly up 0.5 to 4.0 basis points from Monday's close.\nThe 2015 fed funds contracts were flat, suggesting little change in the view among traders on timing whether the Fed would raise interest rates by year-end.\nThe Dec fed funds contract implied traders see a 60 percent of a rate hike in December, little changed from Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.\n(Reporting by Richard Leong ; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )",

That placed it just outside the top 10 biggest mines in Chile, which produces about one-third of the world's copper.\nEl Abra's workforce comprised about 1,600 employees and 1,400 contractors.\nAny labor action would be a fresh headache for state-run Codelco, which owns the remaining 49 percent stake in El Abra. Codelco has just resolved a three-week dispute with contractor workers across its operations, which cost some 17,000 tonnes in lost output.

The monetary authority has been buying yuan to support the exchange rate since a surprise devaluation on Aug. 11. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for August dropped to a three-year low, according to figures released Tuesday.\nThe seven-day repo rate, a gauge of interbank funding availability, fell six basis points to 2.36 percent as of 10:12 a.m. in Shanghai, according to National Interbank Funding Center prices. Chinese financial markets will be closed on Thursday and Friday for public holidays.\n“The weak economy needs ample money supply, and the currency-market intervention also needs injections to offset liquidity tightening,” said Zhang Guoyu, a Shanghai-based analyst at Tebon Securities Co. “The PBOC will probably continue short-term liquidity injections after the holiday.”\nThe PBOC sold 150 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) of seven-day reverse repos at 2.35 percent on Tuesday, according to a statement on its website. That matched the amount of similar contracts that are maturing, leading to a neutral position in open-market operations.\nThe central bank pumped 140 billion yuan of funds into the financial system on Monday via six-day Short-term Liquidity Operations. That matched the amount of similar contracts sold on Aug. 26 and due Tuesday. The central bank also injected 60 billion yuan via seven-day SLO on Aug. 28.\nThe cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed payment to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, fell one basis point to 2.41 percent. The yield on the sovereign notes due July 2025 declined one basis point to 3.32 percent, according to data from the National Interbank Funding Center.",

This matches the best introductory deal previously available, offered by Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank. \nThe First Direct 1st Account also includes a 15.9% APR overdraft, which is interest-free on the first £250. There's a £5 daily fee for unauthorised overdrafts. \nThe account doesn't pay interest on in-credit balances but customers are eligible for the First Direct Regular Saver, which pays a market-leading 6% AER for a year on monthly deposits of £25 to £300. \nFor those looking for interest on their current account deposits, the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank accounts pay 2% AER on the first £2,000 in the account, and for larger balances, the Santander 123 account (which has a £2 a month fee) pays up to 3% interest on balances between £3,000 and £20,000. \nPeter Harrison, head of money at MoneySupermarket, said: \"Ultimately, people need different things from their current account, some are always in credit so should look for big cash incentives and in-credit interest, but others will need to check how much they will be charged for using an overdraft. \n\"The First Direct deal is a corker as it offers both one of the biggest cash incentives we've seen for a long time, and is notoriously popular with customers wanting to be looked after.\" Watch out for charges After the first six months, 1st Account customers are charged a monthly £10 banking fee, unless they pay in £1,000 a month, or keep an average balance of more than £1,000. Additionally, people who hold some other products with First Direct can avoid the monthly charge. \nShould you switch to the 1st Account and decide you're not happy with the service, First Direct is unique in offering you another £100 if you leave within a year of joining.",

This matches the best introductory deal previously available, offered by Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank. \nThe First Direct 1st Account also includes a 15.9% APR overdraft, which is interest-free on the first £250. There's a £5 daily fee for unauthorised overdrafts. \nThe account doesn't pay interest on in-credit balances but customers are eligible for the First Direct Regular Saver, which pays a market-leading 6% AER for a year on monthly deposits of £25 to £300. \nFor those looking for interest on their current account deposits, the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank accounts pay 2% AER on the first £2,000 in the account, and for larger balances, the Santander 123 account (which has a £2 a month fee) pays up to 3% interest on balances between £3,000 and £20,000. \nPeter Harrison, head of money at MoneySupermarket, said: \"Ultimately, people need different things from their current account, some are always in credit so should look for big cash incentives and in-credit interest, but others will need to check how much they will be charged for using an overdraft. \n\"The First Direct deal is a corker as it offers both one of the biggest cash incentives we've seen for a long time, and is notoriously popular with customers wanting to be looked after.\" Watch out for charges After the first six months, 1st Account customers are charged a monthly £10 banking fee, unless they pay in £1,000 a month, or keep an average balance of more than £1,000. Additionally, people who hold some other products with First Direct can avoid the monthly charge. \nShould you switch to the 1st Account and decide you're not happy with the service, First Direct is unique in offering you another £100 if you leave within a year of joining.",

The group said a restructuring undertaken after the financial crisis took longer to take effect in Europe than many other parts of the world.\nWPP also said trading had improved slightly in China, although the world's second largest economy remained under pressure.\n\"We don't expect any major changes to consensus,\" Liberum analysts said in a note. \"We remain cautious on the agencies but we do see WPP as the best positioned of the agencies and see these results as confirmation that Publicis recent weak results are likely due to firm-specific issues.\"\nAnalysts said WPP should benefit from more favourable comparatives in the fourth quarter as it did in the third.

This was at 2.6 percent for the first nine months.\nShares in the group were down 1.8 percent by 0811 GMT. In the last month, they rose 8 percent.

This follows a payment of the same amount made in September. \nSigns of a regular payments reassured investors that the company will be able to stay afloat as weak oil prices provide additional pressure to the balance sheet. \n\"The establishment of a regular payment cycle is crucial for attracting a farm-in partner or strategic investor to pursue the next stage of development at the Shaikan field,\" said analysts at Mirabaud Securities. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in GKP were trading up 4.3 percent at 1030 GMT. \n\"Today's payment is another important step towards the regular payment cycle, and is in keeping with the Ministry of Natural Resources' recent assurances,\" said GKP chief executive Jon Ferrier, whose company had arrears of $283 million in late June. \nA source close to fellow Iraqi Kurdistan oil producer Genel said the company was expecting a payment shortly. \nGenel, whose shares were up 3 percent, declined to comment. \nNorway's DNO (Oslo: DNOFUT.OL - news ) , which is also active in the region, was not immediately available for comment. Its stock was trading up 7 percent in Oslo. \nThe Kurdistan Regional Government promised in September it would start making regular payments for oil exports. \nThe KRG has increased its own crude sales since mid-June, cutting allocations to Iraq's state oil marketing firm SOMO in an ongoing tug-of-war over export rights and budget payments. \nThe dispute has plunged the region into financial crisis compounded by the drop in oil prices. \n(Reporting by Karolin Schaps; Additional reporting by Stine Jacobsen in Oslo, editing by William Hardy)",

This follows a payment of the same amount made in September. \nSigns of a regular payments reassured investors that the company will be able to stay afloat as weak oil prices provide additional pressure to the balance sheet. \n\"The establishment of a regular payment cycle is crucial for attracting a farm-in partner or strategic investor to pursue the next stage of development at the Shaikan field,\" said analysts at Mirabaud Securities. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in GKP were trading up 4.3 percent at 1030 GMT. \n\"Today's payment is another important step towards the regular payment cycle, and is in keeping with the Ministry of Natural Resources' recent assurances,\" said GKP chief executive Jon Ferrier, whose company had arrears of $283 million in late June. \nA source close to fellow Iraqi Kurdistan oil producer Genel said the company was expecting a payment shortly. \nGenel, whose shares were up 3 percent, declined to comment. \nNorway's DNO (Oslo: DNOFUT.OL - news ) , which is also active in the region, was not immediately available for comment. Its stock was trading up 7 percent in Oslo. \nThe Kurdistan Regional Government promised in September it would start making regular payments for oil exports. \nThe KRG has increased its own crude sales since mid-June, cutting allocations to Iraq's state oil marketing firm SOMO in an ongoing tug-of-war over export rights and budget payments. \nThe dispute has plunged the region into financial crisis compounded by the drop in oil prices. \n(Reporting by Karolin Schaps; Additional reporting by Stine Jacobsen in Oslo, editing by William Hardy)",

For the fiscal year the operation met its key targets of tonnes milled, recoveries and head grades, whilst falling short of the total copper and gold metal production guidance. \nIt has been a year of significant progress for Rambler, most notably with the results of the pre-feasibility engineering study and economic assessment ('PFS') aimed to integrate the Lower Footwall Zone ('LFZ') mineral resource into the life of mine plan for the Ming Mine. The results of this defined a staged, low capital strategy for the optimisation of the existing infrastructure allowing the operation to run at full capacity of 1,250 metric tonnes per day by 2018. Importantly it has also extended the life of Ming Mine from 6 to 21 years. As a Canadian producer, we continue to advance and develop other opportunities within the region and benefit from not only working in one of the safest jurisdictions in the world, but also from selling our commodities in US dollars whilst most of our costs remain in Canadian Dollars.

Rentrak’s data help Tranter determine exactly where candidates can get the most value for their ad dollars. Rather than advising campaigns to spend $3,000 on prime-time broadcast slots in Des Moines, he tells them to buy airtime during reruns of  Law & Order  on TNT, at a fraction of the cost.\nIt’s a strategy devised and perfected by former Obama campaign staffer Carol Davidsen, who joined Rentrak in January to oversee political analytics. “My job isn’t to target TV, my job is to figure out that you’re a vote I care about, and what do you do with your time all day long,” says Tranter, whose firm, Optimus, does work for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign, according to federal election records. “Carol’s very good at piecing all of these different technologies together.”\nBy hiring Davidsen, Rentrak has solidified its hold on the data driving political ad spending for the 2016 campaign. Incorporated in 1977, the company originally tracked movie rental inventories, then reinvented itself as a monitoring service for box-office sales. As people began watching movies on cable and on demand, Rentrak developed relationships with service providers to get viewership data it sold to movie studios and advertisers.",

Rentrak’s data help Tranter determine exactly where candidates can get the most value for their ad dollars. Rather than advising campaigns to spend $3,000 on prime-time broadcast slots in Des Moines, he tells them to buy airtime during reruns of  Law & Order  on TNT, at a fraction of the cost.\nIt’s a strategy devised and perfected by former Obama campaign staffer Carol Davidsen, who joined Rentrak in January to oversee political analytics. “My job isn’t to target TV, my job is to figure out that you’re a vote I care about, and what do you do with your time all day long,” says Tranter, whose firm, Optimus, does work for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign, according to federal election records. “Carol’s very good at piecing all of these different technologies together.”\nBy hiring Davidsen, Rentrak has solidified its hold on the data driving political ad spending for the 2016 campaign. Incorporated in 1977, the company originally tracked movie rental inventories, then reinvented itself as a monitoring service for box-office sales. As people began watching movies on cable and on demand, Rentrak developed relationships with service providers to get viewership data it sold to movie studios and advertisers.",

GE's revenues from oil and gas sank 15.9 percent to $3.9 billion. \nEarnings in the year-ago period were boosted by profits from finance operations that are no longer counted. \nGE has announced sales of more than $126 billion in assets as it moves to scale back its finance arm to emphasize industrial operations. \nAnalysts have warned that year-over-year comparisons are difficult at GE because of the major reshuffling of assets. \n\"Our portfolio transformation is happening at an unprecedented pace,\" said GE chief executive Jeff Immelt. \"We are transforming GE into the world's premier Digital Industrial company.\" \nEarnings translated into 29 cents per share, three cents above analyst estimates. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) of GE fell 1.5 percent to $27.62 in pre-market trade.",

GE's revenues from oil and gas sank 15.9 percent to $3.9 billion. \nEarnings in the year-ago period were boosted by profits from finance operations that are no longer counted. \nGE has announced sales of more than $126 billion in assets as it moves to scale back its finance arm to emphasize industrial operations. \nAnalysts have warned that year-over-year comparisons are difficult at GE because of the major reshuffling of assets. \n\"Our portfolio transformation is happening at an unprecedented pace,\" said GE chief executive Jeff Immelt. \"We are transforming GE into the world's premier Digital Industrial company.\" \nEarnings translated into 29 cents per share, three cents above analyst estimates. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) of GE fell 1.5 percent to $27.62 in pre-market trade.",

Morgan (Other OTC: MGHL - news ) , Société Générale - in respect of the venture and additional shareholders are expected to join in the coming months. \nCurveGlobal plans to initially offer trading in short-term interest rate futures in Euribor and short sterling and long-term interest rate futures in bund, bobl, schatz and gilts. \nLSE said additional products are expected to be rolled out following the launch phase. The products will be traded on the London Stock Exchange Derivatives Market, and cleared through its LCH.Clearnet subsidiary, subject to regulatory approvals and necessary licences. \nThe FTSE 100 group said it will make an initial investment of £9.5m in the venture, which is about a third of the expected total funding capital requirements for the venture, in exchange for a 31.67% stake. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the shareholding would drop to around 25% as additional shareholders join. \nChief executive Xavier Rolet said: \"CurveGlobal is an exciting and innovative initiative for our customers and one that complements the recently announced portfolio margining solution from LCH.Clearnet's SwapClear business (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"",

That hack affected payment data for fewer than 3,500 people, the Wall Street Journal reported. \nThe current hack is considered far more serious. Bloomberg said it was not clear if the two incidents were related. \nThe case comes on the heels of numerous other hacking episodes involving sensitive market information.
