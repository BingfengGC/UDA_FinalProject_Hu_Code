        "text": "-2.06 \n(Adds Dassault, background) \nPARIS, Aug 21 (Reuters) - India's purchase of French Rafale fighter jets could be concluded in about 10 days, a source with knowledge of talks on the deal told Reuters on Friday. \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in April he had ordered 36 Rafale fighters to modernise his country's warplane fleet, though detailed terms and conditions remained to be settled. \nModi had opted to deal directly with the French government after three years of inconclusive negotiations with the plane's manufacturer, Dassault. \n\"Things are getting better with India,\" the source said. \"An agreement could be seen in about 10 days.\" \nDassault Aviation (Paris: FR0000121725 - news ) was not immediately available to comment. \nIndia's announcement came after Dassault in February won its first export order for the jets from Egypt. Since then, Qatar has also placed an order, and talks are under way with Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. \nBut the Indian deal ran into trouble, with both sides wrangling over the unit price of the aircraft and a condition that Dassault should invest a big percentage of the value of the multi-billion dollar contract in India, sources said earlier this month. \nIndia is keen to modernise its ageing airforce, with military officials having warned of a major capability gap opening up with China and Pakistan without new Western warplanes, or if local defence contractors cannot build what the military needs in a timely manner.

Since then, Qatar has also placed an order, and talks are under way with Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. \nBut the Indian deal ran into trouble, with both sides wrangling over the unit price of the aircraft and a condition that Dassault should invest a big percentage of the value of the multi-billion dollar contract in India, sources said earlier this month. \nIndia is keen to modernise its ageing airforce, with military officials having warned of a major capability gap opening up with China and Pakistan without new Western warplanes, or if local defence contractors cannot build what the military needs in a timely manner.

Due to client confidentiality we are unable to comment further,\" a CBA spokesman said. The development was first reported by Fairfax Media. \nEnvironmentalists hailed the CBA's decision and said it cast more doubt on the project's future. \n\"As an adviser, Commonwealth Bank was in line to be a leading lender to Adani's Carmichael mega coal mine,\" said Julien Vincent, Executive Director at environmental campaigning group Market Forces. \"Adani has not just lost hundreds of millions of dollars in debt finance that CBA could have brought, but the credibility that a major Australian institution's support brought to the project. That's a bigger, more embarrassing blow and could cost this project billions of dollars.\" \nAdani, which had suspended work in a number of areas on the mine because of delays in obtaining government approvals, said it had ended the bank's mandate over the holdups. \n\"In the event the (government) approvals framework is not further undermined by activists seeking to exploit legal loopholes - thus enabling the project and the thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment it would bring to be delivered - Adani would happily work with the bank in future.\" \n(Reporting by Lincoln Feast; Editing by Grant McCool)",

Learn more... \nThu, Aug 6, 2015, 01:53 BST - UK Markets open in 6 hrs 7 mins Bank ends adviser role in blow for Adani's Australian coal mine Reuters – 1 hour 59 minutes ago Print \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX), the country's largest lender, has ended its role as financial adviser to Indian conglomerate Adani Mining's (ADEL.NS) multibillion dollar Carmichael Mine, a further blow to the controversial project. \nThe exit of CBA comes hard on the heels of a court decision on Wednesday revoking the Australian government's environmental approval for the coal mine, which at an estimated cost of up to $16 billion, is one of the world's biggest under construction. \n\"We confirm that our advisory role has concluded. Due to client confidentiality we are unable to comment further,\" a CBA spokesman said. The development was first reported by Fairfax Media. \nEnvironmentalists hailed the CBA's decision and said it cast more doubt on the project's future. \n\"As an adviser, Commonwealth Bank was in line to be a leading lender to Adani's Carmichael mega coal mine,\" said Julien Vincent, Executive Director at environmental campaigning group Market Forces. \"Adani has not just lost hundreds of millions of dollars in debt finance that CBA could have brought, but the credibility that a major Australian institution's support brought to the project. That's a bigger, more embarrassing blow and could cost this project billions of dollars.\" \nAdani, which had suspended work in a number of areas on the mine because of delays in obtaining government approvals, said it had ended the bank's mandate over the holdups. \n\"In the event the (government) approvals framework is not further undermined by activists seeking to exploit legal loopholes - thus enabling the project and the thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment it would bring to be delivered - Adani would happily work with the bank in future.\" \n(Reporting by Lincoln Feast; Editing by Grant McCool)",

Learn more... \nSun, Aug 2, 2015, 20:01 BST - UK Markets closed Iran wants to buy 90 planes a year to renovate fleet AFP – 7 minutes ago View Photo \n\nIran plans on buying 80 to 90 Airbus and Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) passenger planes per year until 300 are in place to replace its ageing fleet, media reported Sunday quoting a civil aviation official. \nCivil Aviation Organisation (CAO) deputy chief Mohammad Khodakarami said the July 14 nuclear deal struck with Western powers lifts a ban preventing Iran from purchasing new planes and spare parts. \n\"We must add 80 to 90 planes to our fleet each year in order to have 300 new and operational ones,\" Khodakarami was quoted as saying. \nHe said the CAO would renovate the national fleet by purchasing an equal number of Airbus and Boeing planes at an estimated cost of $20 billion (18.2 billion euros). \nAn embargo dating from 1995 prevents Western manufacturers from selling equipment and spare parts to Iranian companies. \nThe restrictions, which have been blamed for crippling the industry, were partially lifted by an interim agreement on Iran's nuclear programme that came into force in January 2014. \nThis allowed for the sale of spare parts, though direct sales of planes remained banned. \nKhodakarami said the historic deal struck in July \"stipulates clearly that the ban on buying or leasing planes as well as the transfer of engines or spare parts has been lifted\". \nIn May, Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi said that Iranian airlines had obtained 15 used planes since February as part of efforts to renovate the country's ageing fleet. \nAnd Iranian aviation officials said in April that the country would need 400 to 500 passenger planes in the next decade. \nThe Iranian fleet has around 140 aircraft, most 20 years old and in desperate need of replacement.",

Tsipras resigned on Thursday.\nWith 25 lawmakers, the party would be the third largest bloc in Greece's 300-seat parliament ahead of the centrist To Potami and far-right Golden Dawn parties, which each have 17 lawmakers.\n(Reporting by George Georgiopoulos, Writing by Deepa Babington; editing by David Stamp)",

The airline revised its schedule on Friday to reflect the change, part of a broader 15-to-20 percent cut in capacity to the Middle East and Africa that Delta announced in April.\n\"The reduction comes amid overcapacity on U.S. routes to the Middle East operated by government-owned and subsidized airlines,\" Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said in a statement, noting that daily service would return in the spring of 2016.\nDelta said months ago that its international capacity cuts were in response to falling crude prices hitting demand in oil-rich markets and to the strong U.S. dollar that has hurt the spending power of foreign travelers.\nYet the latest news underscores a trade row that is rippling through Washington.\nLarge U.S. unions and airlines, led by Delta, charge that Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways have received some $42 billion in subsidies from their home governments in the past decade. They say this has allowed the Gulf carriers to start dumping capacity into the United States, driving down prices and pushing out competitors.\nThe Gulf carriers have denied that they are subsidized and say poor customer service has caused U.S. airlines to lose market share.\nOther U.S. carriers such as JetBlue Airways Corp and the air cargo unit of FedEx Corp have backed the Gulf airlines, saying that government action would signal an abandonment of the United States' liberal trade policy in favor of protectionism.\nThe Obama administration is currently reviewing the issue.\nDelta is the only airline that flies between Atlanta and Dubai. Its service reduction will leave the Washington-Dubai flights on rival United Continental Holdings Inc as the only remaining daily nonstop on a U.S. carrier this winter.\nEmirates operates a freighter service to Atlanta and currently flies passengers to nine U.S. cities from Dubai, with plans to add more. Qatar Airways will launch Atlanta-Doha flights in July 2016. (Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Gareth Jones)",

The shares will open at 120p on Tuesday. \nAs well as Marwyn, the major shareholders on the first day of trading include Invesco (NYSE: IVZ - news ) , the hedge fund Ruffer, and Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) . They have committed to stumping up more cash when Gloo is ready to sign its first deal, expected within months. \nThe team behind the plan, chief executive Rebecca Miskin, a former senior executive at Hearst, and Juan Lopez-Valcarcel, who most recently worked in digital education at Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) , are now hunting the US, UK and Europe for acquisitions. \nIt is understood that they hope to buy in the UK first. Gloo will seek to combine “marquee” traditional print or video brands that have yet to make a successful leap to digital distribution, and combine them with technological know-how \nThat might mean linking a traditional magazine with apps that make it easy for readers to buy featured products, or a major overhaul of the digital nuts and bolts of the business to gain insights on readers for advertisers, according to people familiar with the strategy. In the long-term Gloo aims to become a sustainable large-scale media group that will seek a transfer to London’s main market. \nThe company currently has only one member of staff beyond Ms Miskin and Mr Lopez-Valcarcel, and is headquartered in an attic at Marwyn’s offices, but has access to the investor’s analysts and due diligence resources. \nMarwyn is pursuing a similar strategy in the European telecoms market via Zegona Communications (LSE: ZEG.L - news ) . It listed as a shell in March and last month wrote its first big cheque when it agreed to buy the Spanish operator Telecable de Asturias for €640m.",

They have committed to stumping up more cash when Gloo is ready to sign its first deal, expected within months. \nThe team behind the plan, chief executive Rebecca Miskin, a former senior executive at Hearst, and Juan Lopez-Valcarcel, who most recently worked in digital education at Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) , are now hunting the US, UK and Europe for acquisitions. \nIt is understood that they hope to buy in the UK first. Gloo will seek to combine “marquee” traditional print or video brands that have yet to make a successful leap to digital distribution, and combine them with technological know-how \nThat might mean linking a traditional magazine with apps that make it easy for readers to buy featured products, or a major overhaul of the digital nuts and bolts of the business to gain insights on readers for advertisers, according to people familiar with the strategy. In the long-term Gloo aims to become a sustainable large-scale media group that will seek a transfer to London’s main market. \nThe company currently has only one member of staff beyond Ms Miskin and Mr Lopez-Valcarcel, and is headquartered in an attic at Marwyn’s offices, but has access to the investor’s analysts and due diligence resources. \nMarwyn is pursuing a similar strategy in the European telecoms market via Zegona Communications (LSE: ZEG.L - news ) . It listed as a shell in March and last month wrote its first big cheque when it agreed to buy the Spanish operator Telecable de Asturias for €640m.",

But the GDP contraction was shallower than a median market forecast of a 1.9 percent fall.\n\"There are concerns about consumption, but there are also slight expectations that the government may launch further economic support measures and today's market gains reflect that,\" said Hikaru Sato, senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities.\nAnalysts say that China's economic slowdown and its impact on its Asian neighbours have also heightened the chance that any rebound in growth in July-September will be modest.\nLast week, global markets, including Japan, were rattled after China devalued its currency.\n\"Volatility in the market seemed to have settled for now, but in the long-term, risks that Beijing may launch another surprising action may cap further gains,\" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\nInvestors seemed to shy away from global cyclical shares and shifted to domestic-demand sensitive firms.\nFinancials led the gains on Monday, with insurers advancing 2.5 percent and banks rising 1.2 percent. Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings jumped 3.0 percent and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co surged 2.2 percent.\nSumitomo Mitsui Financial Group rose 1.5 percent.\nKikkoman Corp soared 3.5 percent after SMBC Nikko Securities hiked its target price to 3,600 yen from 2,970 yen, citing strong sales of soy milk products in the domestic market and lower marketing fees.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.7 percent to 1,675.30 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 also advanced 0.7 percent to 15,099.34.

But the GDP contraction was shallower than a median market forecast of a 1.9 percent fall.\n\"There are concerns about consumption, but there are also slight expectations that the government may launch further economic support measures and today's market gains reflect that,\" said Hikaru Sato, senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities.\nAnalysts say that China's economic slowdown and its impact on its Asian neighbours have also heightened the chance that any rebound in growth in July-September will be modest.\nLast week, global markets, including Japan, were rattled after China devalued its currency.\n\"Volatility in the market seemed to have settled for now, but in the long-term, risks that Beijing may launch another surprising action may cap further gains,\" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\nInvestors seemed to shy away from global cyclical shares and shifted to domestic-demand sensitive firms.\nFinancials led the gains on Monday, with insurers advancing 2.5 percent and banks rising 1.2 percent. Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings jumped 3.0 percent and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co surged 2.2 percent.\nSumitomo Mitsui Financial Group rose 1.5 percent.\nKikkoman Corp soared 3.5 percent after SMBC Nikko Securities hiked its target price to 3,600 yen from 2,970 yen, citing strong sales of soy milk products in the domestic market and lower marketing fees.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.7 percent to 1,675.30 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 also advanced 0.7 percent to 15,099.34.

Greek officials have previously said they expect the bailout accord to go to the country's parliament for approval by Aug. 18. \n\"Efforts are being made to conclude the negotiations, the horizon is by Monday night or early Tuesday,\" said a Greek official who declined to be named. \n\"When the new bailout comes to parliament for a vote it will be one bill with two articles - one article will be the loan agreement and the MoU (memorandum of understanding) and the second article will be the prior actions,\" the official said, referring to measures Greece needs to take for the bailout accord to take effect. \nThe negotiations began on July 20. A senior Greek finance official told Reuters the aim was for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers to review the accord on Friday, Aug. 14. \nAthens is negotiating with European Union institutions and the International Monetary Fund for up to 86 billion euros (£60.89 billion) in fresh loans to stave off economic collapse and stay in the euro zone. The bailout must be in place by Aug. 20, when Greece has a repayment falling due to the European Central Bank. \n(Reporting By George Georgiopoulos; Writing by Michele Kambas; Editing by Digby Lidstone)",

Greek officials have previously said they expect the bailout accord to go to the country's parliament for approval by Aug. 18. \n\"Efforts are being made to conclude the negotiations, the horizon is by Monday night or early Tuesday,\" said a Greek official who declined to be named. \n\"When the new bailout comes to parliament for a vote it will be one bill with two articles - one article will be the loan agreement and the MoU (memorandum of understanding) and the second article will be the prior actions,\" the official said, referring to measures Greece needs to take for the bailout accord to take effect. \nThe negotiations began on July 20. A senior Greek finance official told Reuters the aim was for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers to review the accord on Friday, Aug. 14. \nAthens is negotiating with European Union institutions and the International Monetary Fund for up to 86 billion euros (£60.89 billion) in fresh loans to stave off economic collapse and stay in the euro zone. The bailout must be in place by Aug. 20, when Greece has a repayment falling due to the European Central Bank. \n(Reporting By George Georgiopoulos; Writing by Michele Kambas; Editing by Digby Lidstone)",

Up to Friday's close, the stock had nearly halved in value over the past year. (Reporting by Shubhankar Chakravorty in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Kirti Pandey)",

The results compared with a net loss of $26 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier.\nUninsured and charity admissions fell more than 31 percent in six states that expanded their Medicaid programs, Tenet said.\nHospitals are experiencing a rise in patient visits due to the expansion of insurance to more Americans under the Affordable Care Act.\nTenet said its overall adjusted patient admissions, which include both inpatient and outpatient figures, increased 2.3 percent from a year ago at facilities operated for at least one year.\nNet operating revenue, after provision for doubtful accounts, rose 11 percent to $4.49 billion in the second quarter.

The results compared with a net loss of $26 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier.\nUninsured and charity admissions fell more than 31 percent in six states that expanded their Medicaid programs, Tenet said.\nHospitals are experiencing a rise in patient visits due to the expansion of insurance to more Americans under the Affordable Care Act.\nTenet said its overall adjusted patient admissions, which include both inpatient and outpatient figures, increased 2.3 percent from a year ago at facilities operated for at least one year.\nNet operating revenue, after provision for doubtful accounts, rose 11 percent to $4.49 billion in the second quarter.

Jay Park as an independent legal advisor to the ministry. \nA letter drafted on Monday by the chairman of the UN's Somalia-Eritrea Sanctions Committee, Venezuelan Ambassador to the UN Rafael Ramirez, called on Somalia to investigate. \nIn 2013, Soma, chaired by former British Conservative Party leader Michael Howard, won a lucrative contract to survey Somalia's southern and central coast, and it later secured the rights to explore 12 offshore oil and gas blocks. \nThe deal raised hopes of reviving Somalia's oil and gas industry, on hold for decades during civil war and years of Islamic insurgency. \nBut the sanctions committee letter, seen by AFP on Tuesday, requests that Somali authorities \"promptly investigate and undertake prosecutions, where appropriate, of individuals and entities found to have been engaged in misappropriation of public resources in violation of the Somalia sanctions regime.\" \nThe report stated that \"the (monitoring) group has obtained evidence demonstrating that Soma has been making regular payments since June 2014 to civil servants in the ministry of petroleum and mineral resources, some of whom were instrumental in both securing the company's initial contract and negotiating subsequent agreements.\" \nSoma has denied any wrongdoing and said in a statement on Monday that the UN monitors had \"fundamentally misunderstood the nature, purpose and destination of the payments made.\" \nBritain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) opened a criminal investigation against Soma following the allegations. \nSecurity Council members have until August 10 to raise objections to the draft letter.",

The exception is October, the month in which stocks crashed in 1987.\nAugust’s first two days of trading brought S&P 500 losses of 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, followed by a 0.3 percent gain yesterday. In the first seven months of the year, the index’s moves crossed the 1 percent threshold 33 times on a closing basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n“The market itself may also be telling us that more volatility -- along with a disappointing overall price performance -- lies ahead,” Stovall wrote. The ratio of the S&P 500 high beta and low volatility indexes is sending this signal, the New York-based strategist wrote.\nThe high-beta index fell 10 percent through yesterday from this year’s high, set on April 23. The indicator tracks the 100 companies in the S&P 500 that fluctuated the most relative to the index during the past 12 months. The low-volatility index, comprised of 100 stocks that swung the least, rose 1.3 percent during the same period.\n“Investors have been in a ‘risk-off’ mindset,” Stovall wrote. “In the month ahead, investors may therefore be more inclined to focus on their tans than on their portfolios.”",

        "text": "BEIJING Aug 11 A former General Motors Co sales and marketing executive, Joseph Liu, has joined Ford Motor Co's China unit - a move ex-colleagues of the auto industry veteran describe as a big gain for Ford.\nLiu was instrumental in helping make GM's Buick and other brands a leading passenger car force in China, GM has said in the past. The 57-year-old is one of the most experienced and insightful executives in the world's largest car market, said former colleagues, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media on the matter.\nFord said in an internal announcement that Liu, who retired in 2014 as executive vice president of GM's main joint venture in China, has joined its China operations as vice president of marketing and sales.\nThe appointment, effective Aug. 1, comes as Ford's China sales have weakened on a market slump, a slower economy and stock market gyrations. It sales fell 6 percent in July from a year earlier to 77,100 vehicles and are down 0.7 percent for the year to date.\nBefore joining Shanghai GM, Liu worked for GM's Asia Pacific unit with a focus on China and served as managing director and president of GM Taiwan.\nLiu also earlier spent 15 years with Ford Lio Ho Motors in Taiwan, where he held various senior positions in planning, marketing, sales and after-sales.

        "text_full": "Auto executive who helped build up Buick in China joins Ford\nBEIJING Aug 11 A former General Motors Co sales and marketing executive, Joseph Liu, has joined Ford Motor Co's China unit - a move ex-colleagues of the auto industry veteran describe as a big gain for Ford.\nLiu was instrumental in helping make GM's Buick and other brands a leading passenger car force in China, GM has said in the past. The 57-year-old is one of the most experienced and insightful executives in the world's largest car market, said former colleagues, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media on the matter.\nFord said in an internal announcement that Liu, who retired in 2014 as executive vice president of GM's main joint venture in China, has joined its China operations as vice president of marketing and sales.\nThe appointment, effective Aug. 1, comes as Ford's China sales have weakened on a market slump, a slower economy and stock market gyrations. It sales fell 6 percent in July from a year earlier to 77,100 vehicles and are down 0.7 percent for the year to date.\nBefore joining Shanghai GM, Liu worked for GM's Asia Pacific unit with a focus on China and served as managing director and president of GM Taiwan.\nLiu also earlier spent 15 years with Ford Lio Ho Motors in Taiwan, where he held various senior positions in planning, marketing, sales and after-sales.

        "text": "WASHINGTON Aug 7 The United States has added a Russian oil and gas field, the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye Field, to its list of energy industry sector sanctions prompted by Moscow's actions in Ukraine.\nThe federal government said on Thursday the field, located in the Sea of Okhotsk of the Siberian coast and owned by Russia's leading gas producer Gazprom, contains substantial reserves of oil in addition to reserves of gas.\n\"The Yuzhno-Kirinskoye Field is being added to the Entity List because it is reported to contain substantial reserves of oil,\" according to a rule notice in the Federal Register.\nGazprom declined to comment.\nAdding the field to the list means a license will be required for exports, re-exports or transfers of oil from that location, it said. The gas and condensate field was discovered in 2010, according to Gazprom.\nDouglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer in Washington, said the addition \"represents a new arrow in the quiver of U.S. sanctions on Russia.\"\nHe said the addition means that no U.S. origin items or non-U.S. origin items containing more than 25 percent U.S. content can be exported or re-exported to the field without a Commerce Department license, which he said was not likely to be issued.\n\"This goes beyond the current Russia sanctions, which prohibit certain items to be exported to Russia when they are used directly or indirectly in the exploration for, or production of, oil or gas in Russian deepwater (greater than 500 feet),\" Jacobsen said in an email.\nThe action builds on those taken since last year by the United States and the European Union after Russia's annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine.\nLast week, the United States imposed additional Russia and Ukraine-related sanctions, adding associates of a billionaire Russian gas trader, Crimean port operators and former Ukrainian officials to its list of those it is penalizing in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine.

The gas and condensate field was discovered in 2010, according to Gazprom.\nDouglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer in Washington, said the addition \"represents a new arrow in the quiver of U.S. sanctions on Russia.\"\nHe said the addition means that no U.S. origin items or non-U.S. origin items containing more than 25 percent U.S. content can be exported or re-exported to the field without a Commerce Department license, which he said was not likely to be issued.\n\"This goes beyond the current Russia sanctions, which prohibit certain items to be exported to Russia when they are used directly or indirectly in the exploration for, or production of, oil or gas in Russian deepwater (greater than 500 feet),\" Jacobsen said in an email.\nThe action builds on those taken since last year by the United States and the European Union after Russia's annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine.\nLast week, the United States imposed additional Russia and Ukraine-related sanctions, adding associates of a billionaire Russian gas trader, Crimean port operators and former Ukrainian officials to its list of those it is penalizing in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine.

On a quarterly and annual bases, profit rose about 14 percent and 27 percent, respectively, BM&FBovespa said in a statement.\nUncertainty over Brazil's deteriorating political and fiscal situation led investors to increase trading of derivatives and currency instruments, in line with what BM&FBovespa had previously disclosed in monthly activity reports. The so-called BM&F derivatives segment jumped 33 percent, well above the poll's forecast of a 23 percent increase.\nNet revenue totaled 554.6 million reais, topping the poll's average forecast of 531 million reais. Last quarter, the Bovespa equities segment rose 10 percent from the prior quarter, slightly above expectations.\nThe numbers indicate that BM&FBovespa is riding out Brazil's slump in a relatively comfortable position. The $2.1 trillion economy is flirting with the steepest recession in 25 years, tumbling commodity prices that hamper export revenue, and persistently high inflation that discourage trading of financial securities.\nManagement led by Chief Executive Officer Edemir Pinto plan to discuss results at a Friday event.\nSales, general and administrative expenses came in within forecasts. On a quarterly basis, expenses tumbled almost 11 percent, reflecting Pinto's efforts to contain payroll, outsourcing and marketing spending, the statement said.\nFinancial income rose sharply in the wake of higher interest rates, the statement said.\n($1 = 3.5005 Brazilian reais) (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Bernard Orr )",

On a quarterly and annual bases, profit rose about 14 percent and 27 percent, respectively, BM&FBovespa said in a statement.\nUncertainty over Brazil's deteriorating political and fiscal situation led investors to increase trading of derivatives and currency instruments, in line with what BM&FBovespa had previously disclosed in monthly activity reports. The so-called BM&F derivatives segment jumped 33 percent, well above the poll's forecast of a 23 percent increase.\nNet revenue totaled 554.6 million reais, topping the poll's average forecast of 531 million reais. Last quarter, the Bovespa equities segment rose 10 percent from the prior quarter, slightly above expectations.\nThe numbers indicate that BM&FBovespa is riding out Brazil's slump in a relatively comfortable position. The $2.1 trillion economy is flirting with the steepest recession in 25 years, tumbling commodity prices that hamper export revenue, and persistently high inflation that discourage trading of financial securities.\nManagement led by Chief Executive Officer Edemir Pinto plan to discuss results at a Friday event.\nSales, general and administrative expenses came in within forecasts. On a quarterly basis, expenses tumbled almost 11 percent, reflecting Pinto's efforts to contain payroll, outsourcing and marketing spending, the statement said.\nFinancial income rose sharply in the wake of higher interest rates, the statement said.\n($1 = 3.5005 Brazilian reais) (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Bernard Orr )",

She may not have foreseen that the greenback would surge to an 11-year high against the currency of the U.S.&apos;s biggest trading partner.\nAs the greenback&apos;s advance against the euro and the yen subsided, its 5 percent rally against the Canadian dollar this quarter may prove to be more detrimental to the world&apos;s biggest economy. The U.S.&apos;s northern neighbor buys about 17 percent of America&apos;s products, more than any other nation, data compiled by Bloomberg show. And shipments are already have declined after reaching a record last year.\nSource: Bloomberg data U.S. exports to Canada have declined from record levels reached last year as the Canadian dollar has weakened against the U.S. dollar.\nA firm dollar makes American goods relatively more expensive abroad, presenting a hurdle for Fed officials as they prepare to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.\nThe central bank&apos;s trade-weighted dollar index is approaching the March high that prompted Yellen at the time to warn the currency is weighing on exports and inflation. The index, which includes only major currencies, gives an almost 13 percent weighting to Canada, trailing only the euro area&apos;s influence.\n``Since late June, the speed in the dollar rally is probably equivalent to what we had earlier,&apos;&apos; said Charles St-Arnaud, senior economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in London. ``I can hear some investors saying, `Oh yeah we&apos;re back to where we were in March when the Fed started to be worried about the dollar.&apos;&apos;&apos;",

She may not have foreseen that the greenback would surge to an 11-year high against the currency of the U.S.&apos;s biggest trading partner.\nAs the greenback&apos;s advance against the euro and the yen subsided, its 5 percent rally against the Canadian dollar this quarter may prove to be more detrimental to the world&apos;s biggest economy. The U.S.&apos;s northern neighbor buys about 17 percent of America&apos;s products, more than any other nation, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

The index, which includes only major currencies, gives an almost 13 percent weighting to Canada, trailing only the euro area&apos;s influence.\n``Since late June, the speed in the dollar rally is probably equivalent to what we had earlier,&apos;&apos; said Charles St-Arnaud, senior economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in London. ``I can hear some investors saying, `Oh yeah we&apos;re back to where we were in March when the Fed started to be worried about the dollar.&apos;&apos;&apos;",

Learn more... \nTue, Aug 4, 2015, 15:19 BST - UK Markets close in 1 hr 11 mins Travis Perkins Ups Dividend As House Prices Rise By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 3 hours ago View Photo \n\nRenewed confidence in the recovering construction market has prompted builders' merchant Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) to raise its dividend by over a fifth. \nTravis Perkins' half year results show that profit before tax rose 3.2% to £158.6m as the firm said the housing market was benefiting from \"solid mortgage availability, continuing Government support for first-time buyers and rising house prices\". \nThese financial results come alongside a separate Nationwide data release which showed that UK house prices have returned to growth in July. \nFollowing a surprise blip in June, where house prices fell 0.2% in the month, July saw a recovery with prices jumping 0.4% which equates to a year on year increase of 3.5%. \nThe average UK house price is now £195,621, equivalent to a two-year rise of 14.5% according to Nationwide's statistics. \nCommenting on the figures, Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: \"After moderating over the past 12 months, there are tentative signs that annual house price growth may be stabilising close to the pace of earnings growth, which has historically been around 4%.\" \nLast month the UK's biggest bank, HSBC, raised its UK house price growth forecast for 2015 - from 2% to 5%, to 5% to 10%. \nTravis Perkins' investor release also pointed towards further house price growth as supply side constraints take hold: \"In the UK, demand for housing continues to outpace supply. \n\"Population growth, immigration and a trend towards smaller family units is creating around 225,000 new households per year, while only 141,000 new homes were built in 2014.\" \nThe builders' merchants optimism means that it has raised its dividend per share by 20.4% to 14.75p. \nDespite the increase to the dividend investors opted to dump its stock sending shares 3% lower. Over the last 12 months, however, shares are nearly 30% higher.",

Learn more... \nTue, Aug 4, 2015, 15:19 BST - UK Markets close in 1 hr 11 mins Travis Perkins Ups Dividend As House Prices Rise By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 3 hours ago View Photo \n\nRenewed confidence in the recovering construction market has prompted builders' merchant Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) to raise its dividend by over a fifth. \nTravis Perkins' half year results show that profit before tax rose 3.2% to £158.6m as the firm said the housing market was benefiting from \"solid mortgage availability, continuing Government support for first-time buyers and rising house prices\". \nThese financial results come alongside a separate Nationwide data release which showed that UK house prices have returned to growth in July. \nFollowing a surprise blip in June, where house prices fell 0.2% in the month, July saw a recovery with prices jumping 0.4% which equates to a year on year increase of 3.5%. \nThe average UK house price is now £195,621, equivalent to a two-year rise of 14.5% according to Nationwide's statistics. \nCommenting on the figures, Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: \"After moderating over the past 12 months, there are tentative signs that annual house price growth may be stabilising close to the pace of earnings growth, which has historically been around 4%.\" \nLast month the UK's biggest bank, HSBC, raised its UK house price growth forecast for 2015 - from 2% to 5%, to 5% to 10%. \nTravis Perkins' investor release also pointed towards further house price growth as supply side constraints take hold: \"In the UK, demand for housing continues to outpace supply. \n\"Population growth, immigration and a trend towards smaller family units is creating around 225,000 new households per year, while only 141,000 new homes were built in 2014.\" \nThe builders' merchants optimism means that it has raised its dividend per share by 20.4% to 14.75p. \nDespite the increase to the dividend investors opted to dump its stock sending shares 3% lower. Over the last 12 months, however, shares are nearly 30% higher.",

The trade shortfall for the month was far less than analysts had expected and, coupled with disappointing U.S. private-sector jobs data, helped push the loonie back below C$1.32 to the greenback. The improvement in the trade data was \"very surprising and quite large in magnitude,\" said Don Mikolich, executive director of foreign exchange sales at CIBC World Markets. \"It makes you wonder if we're finally getting some traction from the currency.\" The cheaper currency, with the Canadian dollar hitting its weakest level since 2004 this week, has been expected to lift Canadian exports, though a significant time lag has been expected. At 9:19 a.m. EDT (1319 GMT), the Canadian dollar was at C$1.3142 to the greenback, or 76.09 U.S. cents, stronger than the Bank of Canada's official close on Tuesday of C$1.3180, or 75.87 U.S. cents. The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3110, while its weakest was C$1.3213. Mikolich said the data helped prompt \"a needed correction with the move higher in the last couple of sessions, but with limited scope here much below C$1.31.\" Canadian government bond prices were lower across the maturity curve, with the two-year price down 4 Canadian cents to yield 0.424 percent and the benchmark 10-year falling 26 Canadian cents to yield 1.455 percent. The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was -30.8 basis points, while the 10-year spread was -79.5 basis points. U.S. crude prices were up 0.9 percent at $46.17 a barrel, while Brent crude added 1.1 percent to $50.55. Oil is a major Canadian export. (Reporting by Alastair Sharp; Editing by Peter Galloway)",

It is currently investigating the incident and plans to give customers new bars after that, although it said the investigation could take weeks. \nModels with other serial numbers have not seen any overheating issues, the company said. \nThe Power Bar acts as a battery pack when users are out and about and low on battery. It contains a USB port to which one can affix a charging cable, and claims to have enough capacity to fully charge a smartphone once. \nInside the Power Bar is a typical lithium-ion battery, the type used in almost all of today's portable gadgets. Although overheating is rare, small failures can cause a chain reaction that leads to explosions. \nAround 1.5 million Power Bars have been made available, although only some are affected by the recall. \nEE announced the Power Bar scheme , which gives EE, Orange and T-Mobile customers the portable chargers, in April. It has faced huge demand for them, which has limited supply at times.",

It is currently investigating the incident and plans to give customers new bars after that, although it said the investigation could take weeks. \nModels with other serial numbers have not seen any overheating issues, the company said. \nThe Power Bar acts as a battery pack when users are out and about and low on battery. It contains a USB port to which one can affix a charging cable, and claims to have enough capacity to fully charge a smartphone once. \nInside the Power Bar is a typical lithium-ion battery, the type used in almost all of today's portable gadgets. Although overheating is rare, small failures can cause a chain reaction that leads to explosions. \nAround 1.5 million Power Bars have been made available, although only some are affected by the recall. \nEE announced the Power Bar scheme , which gives EE, Orange and T-Mobile customers the portable chargers, in April. It has faced huge demand for them, which has limited supply at times.",

That was despite an 11.6 percent fall in publishing print sales, its main source of income, as supermarkets and telecom groups spent less on advertising. \nWhile print publishing came in at 235.7 million pounds in the first half, digital publishing revenue grew by 27 percent to 18.9 million pounds. \n\"It was a tough half year for print advertising,\" Chief Executive Simon Fox told Reuters. \"Good cash generation meant we have 24 million pounds of cash on our balance sheet, the first time in our history that we've had cash on our balance sheet.\" \nAnalysts also welcomed the comment that July revenue trends were better than those experienced in May and June, and Fox said he hoped the rate of decline would abate in the second half. \nShares in the group rose 8.3 percent to 144.4 pence by 0828 GMT after a 36 percent drop in the last five months, valuing the owner of national, regional and digital titles at around 370 million pounds.

That was despite an 11.6 percent fall in publishing print sales, its main source of income, as supermarkets and telecom groups spent less on advertising. \nWhile print publishing came in at 235.7 million pounds in the first half, digital publishing revenue grew by 27 percent to 18.9 million pounds. \n\"It was a tough half year for print advertising,\" Chief Executive Simon Fox told Reuters. \"Good cash generation meant we have 24 million pounds of cash on our balance sheet, the first time in our history that we've had cash on our balance sheet.\" \nAnalysts also welcomed the comment that July revenue trends were better than those experienced in May and June, and Fox said he hoped the rate of decline would abate in the second half. \nShares in the group rose 8.3 percent to 144.4 pence by 0828 GMT after a 36 percent drop in the last five months, valuing the owner of national, regional and digital titles at around 370 million pounds.

The bill must also be ratified by at least 15 states before it becomes law. \nJaitley suggested parliament could be reconvened before the winter session scheduled for late this year. \nHe also launched a scathing attack on the main opposition Congress party, saying it had deliberately hobbled parliament where the ruling BJP (Shanghai: 600578.SS - news ) lacks a majority in the upper house. \n\"It (Congress) seems to have a clear policy of hampering any government that isn't their own,\" Jaitley said. \nCompanies have long complained about India's unwieldy levies which they say deter investment and push up prices of locally made goods. The government says the GST, first proposed by Congress during its decade in power before 2014, would add two percentage points to economic growth.",
