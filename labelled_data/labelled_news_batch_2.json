        "text": "July 13 Delta Air Lines Inc has offered to invest in Japan's bankrupt Skymark Airlines Inc as part of a restructuring plan for the budget carrier, according to a Japanese media report.\nThe move has the potential to increase competition in Japan by allowing Delta to funnel international travelers via Tokyo to more Japanese cities that Skymark serves. A deal would give Delta a roughly 20-percent stake, although terms must still be concluded and approved by Skymark's creditors, according to the report by Nikkei Asian Review.\nA Delta spokeswoman said, \"It would be premature for us to comment on the matter.\" Delta's President Ed Bastian said last month that the Atlanta-based airline had been approached about making the investment.\nSkymark could not immediately be reached for comment.\nSkymark holds many landing slots at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, which connects to cities throughout Japan and which many travelers prefer to Narita International Airport because it is closer to Tokyo's downtown. Skymark's slots are for domestic routes only.\nIf the deal succeeds, Delta could attempt to build Haneda as a transit hub for passengers coming off its flights from Los Angeles.

        "text_full": "Delta offers to invest in Japan's bankrupt Skymark Airlines- media\nJuly 13 Delta Air Lines Inc has offered to invest in Japan's bankrupt Skymark Airlines Inc as part of a restructuring plan for the budget carrier, according to a Japanese media report.\nThe move has the potential to increase competition in Japan by allowing Delta to funnel international travelers via Tokyo to more Japanese cities that Skymark serves. A deal would give Delta a roughly 20-percent stake, although terms must still be concluded and approved by Skymark's creditors, according to the report by Nikkei Asian Review.\nA Delta spokeswoman said, \"It would be premature for us to comment on the matter.\" Delta's President Ed Bastian said last month that the Atlanta-based airline had been approached about making the investment.\nSkymark could not immediately be reached for comment.\nSkymark holds many landing slots at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, which connects to cities throughout Japan and which many travelers prefer to Narita International Airport because it is closer to Tokyo's downtown. Skymark's slots are for domestic routes only.\nIf the deal succeeds, Delta could attempt to build Haneda as a transit hub for passengers coming off its flights from Los Angeles. Currently, Delta's connecting opportunities are limited because it has no alliance partner in Japan.\nRival U.S. carrier United Continental Holdings Inc has an alliance with Japan's ANA Holdings Inc, and rival American Airlines Group Inc has an alliance with Japan Airlines Co Ltd.\nPlanemaker Airbus Group SE and aircraft lessor Intrepid Aviation Ltd are the biggest creditors to Skymark, which ran into financial trouble after embarking on an ambitious expansion that included buying Airbus A380 jumbo jets.\nThere are two restructuring plans for Skymark currently on the table, one involving ANA Holdings investing in Skymark, and one proposed by Intrepid.\nCreditor approval is key for either Skymark restructuring plan to go ahead.\n(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Diane Craft)",

This compared to £370m a year ago, although was less than analyst forecasts of £414m. \nBurberry's tie-up with Cara Delevingne has boosted sales of cashmere scarves, perfume and coats \nAt the company’s annual meeting in London on Thursday, the company is facing a rebellion from shareholders over the £7.9m pay package Mr Bailey received last year. \nMr Bailey took over as chief executive from Angela Ahrendts in May 2014, combining it with his role as the company's creative director. \nThe group reported pre-tax profits of £445m for the year ending March 31 , a 1pc fall on the year before. However, adjusting for currency movements, Burberry said that profits in its underlying business had risen by 7pc to £456m during the period.",

Total outward investment was 343.2 billion yuan ($55 billion) during the period, compared with 420.5 billion yuan in FDI.\n“The turning point will take place within this year -- China will be a net provider of investment funds to the world,” said Chen Bingcai, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Governance. “With institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and Silk Road Fund, China’s overseas investment will only accelerate, and this trend will reshape the global economic landscape.”\nWhile the recent stock market turmoil may complicate the outlook, Chinese companies are still looking overseas. The investment arm of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s university is planning to offer $23 billion for chipmaker Micron Technology Inc., a person familiar with the matter said earlier this month, in a deal that would be the largest takeover of a foreign firm by a Chinese company.\nDalian Wanda Group, a property developer run by Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin, has ventured into yachtmaking in Britain and cinema chains around the world.\nForeign direct investment helped China’s economic boom in the past three decades, bringing not only funds but also technologies and knowledge. While China is losing its edge in low-end manufacturing as labor costs rise, its services sector remains attractive -- FDI in China’s financial services surged more than 400 percent in the first half from a year earlier.\n“China’s stock market volatility won’t change the opening-up course,” Chen said.

Learn more... \nFri, Jul 17, 2015, 21:25 BST - UK Markets closed Greek PM reshuffles government after parliament mutiny AFP – 1 hour 10 minutes ago View Photo \n\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Friday reshuffled his government, a day after a major lawmaker mutiny in his radical left Syriza party over a draconian bailout deal. \nIn a bid to show international creditors he is in control of his cabinet, Tsipras ditched energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, the head of Syriza's hardline faction that has consistently demanded an exit from the eurozone. \nThe deputy minister of defence, who was close to Lafazanis, was also axed. \nThe PM also filled the posts of the junior ministers of finance and foreign affairs, who had resigned during the week over the bailout deal, which over half of Greeks had rejected in a referendum. \nLabour minister Panos Skourletis, a close ally of Tsipras, was moved over to replace the outgoing Lafazanis. \nThe new members of the cabinet were set to be sworn in at a ceremony on Saturday (Shenzhen: 002291.SZ - news ) . \nThe reshuffle came just hours after the EU approved a short-term loan for Greece, allowing it to make huge payments as early as next week to its creditors while a new eurozone debt bailout is being hammered out. \nGreek lawmakers voted in favour of the deeply contentious bailout package on Thursday, but the internal rebellion left the radical left government weakened. \nThe PM suffered a major mutiny from his lawmakers -- 32 out of 149 voted against the measures, and a further six abstained -- and he was forced to rely on the support of pro-European opposition parties. \nGovernment spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides was also to be replaced in the reshuffle.",

The Seville-based company’s 7 percent notes sold in April fell 5.4 cents to a record 82.6 cents.\nAbengoa said it was bringing bond guarantees into line because the discrepancy was allowing credit-default swaps traders to distort the cost of insuring its debt. The company is seeking to reassure investors after roiling markets last year by reclassifying some of its high-yield notes as non-recourse, making bondholders lose trust in their corporate guarantee.\n“The company announced measures to stop certain behavior it sees as anomalous,” said Ivan San Felix, a Madrid-based equity analyst at Renta 4 Banco SA. “Rather than calming investors, the market is now punishing the company. It’s more an issue with the market’s view of the company than with internal company issues.”\nDefault Swaps Credit-default swaps insuring 10 million euros of Abengoa’s debt for five years surged to 3.25 million euros upfront and 500,000 euros annually today, the highest since November, according to CMA. That’s up from 1.77 million euros in advance at the start of the month and signals a 75 percent probability of default.\nThere were 2,011 swaps contracts covering $860 million of Abengoa’s debt as of July 17, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. The company’s shares fell as much as 19 percent to 2 euros, the lowest since Jan. 5.\n“You can understand why Abengoa is concerned about their credit-default swap levels,” though it’s unusual for a company to try so directly to influence trading, said Robert Baltzer, an Edinburgh-based investment manager at Baillie Gifford & Co., which oversees about 115 billion pounds ($178 billion). “They need continual access to bond markets and that’s one of the factors that determines the price of funding. They need credit-default swap spreads to be lower.”",

Eurostar posts record passenger numbers in first quarter despite strikes By Jessica Fino | Sharecast – 4 minutes 33 seconds ago 13.29 -0.11 \n  High-speed rail company Eurostar reported record passenger numbers during the second quarter of the year. Over 2.8m customers travelled on Eurostar during the period, an increase of 3% from same time last year. \nThe record numbers were despite disruption during ferry worker strikes in Calais last month over the sale of the MyFerryLink's ferries to the rival DFDS Seaways. \nSales revenues rose 1.5% to £232m during the second quarter. \nHowever, overall sales revenues for the first half of the year fell 2% due to the impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris during the first quarter and the closure of Eurotunnel (Paris: FR0010533075 - news ) following a lorry fire. \nMeanwhile, Eurostar announced its new fleet of trains is in the final stage of testing. The trains will have more seat capacity and will be launched by the end of the year. \nChief executive Nicolas Petrovic said: \"Over the past three months we have carried more passengers than in any other quarter. With demand for our services at an all-time high we are looking forward to the arrival of our new trains. \n\"The combination of state-of-the-art design, unrivalled comfort and 20% extra seats means that we are well placed to meet the growing demand as passengers increasingly opt for high speed rail over plane.\" A new strike over job cuts in the Channel Tunnel terminal near Calais started this Tuesday with ferry workers blocking access to the tunnel and setting fire to tyres.",

It did not identify the individuals or say if they still worked at the business. \nThe investigation will cover 2012 \"and relevant prior periods as a result of the identification of issues within the claims and accounting functions announced by RSA Insurance Group plc at the end of 2013,\" the FRC said in a statement. \nRSA has blamed a handful of executives at the Irish division for accounting irregularities that led to the group to overstating its profits in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) and required it to tap shareholders for cash to plug the hole in its finances. \nThe British insurer was forced to inject 200 million pounds ($310 million) into its Irish unit. \nPhilip Smith, former chief executive of RSA's Irish business who resigned in late 2013, weeks after the insurer informed the market about the irregularities, last month won a 1.25 million euro ($1.4 million) compensation payment for a constructive dismissal case. \nRSA is appealing the award. \nThe FRC said it would cooperate with the Irish authorities as necessary, declining to elaborate. \n($1 = 0.6449 pounds)",

It did not identify the individuals or say if they still worked at the business. \nThe investigation will cover 2012 \"and relevant prior periods as a result of the identification of issues within the claims and accounting functions announced by RSA Insurance Group plc at the end of 2013,\" the FRC said in a statement. \nRSA has blamed a handful of executives at the Irish division for accounting irregularities that led to the group to overstating its profits in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) and required it to tap shareholders for cash to plug the hole in its finances. \nThe British insurer was forced to inject 200 million pounds ($310 million) into its Irish unit. \nPhilip Smith, former chief executive of RSA's Irish business who resigned in late 2013, weeks after the insurer informed the market about the irregularities, last month won a 1.25 million euro ($1.4 million) compensation payment for a constructive dismissal case. \nRSA is appealing the award. \nThe FRC said it would cooperate with the Irish authorities as necessary, declining to elaborate. \n($1 = 0.6449 pounds)",

United did not confirm tweets from individuals who say they have been paid smaller awards as well.\nThe Chicago-based carrier has hoped to trailblaze in the area of airline web security by offering \"bug bounties\" for uncovering cyber risks. Through the program, researchers flag problems before malicious hackers can exploit them. The cost can be less than hiring outside consultancies.\nThree of United's competitors declined to comment on bug bounty programs. A fourth was not immediately available for comment.\nTrade group Airlines for America said in a statement that all U.S. carriers conduct tests to make sure their systems are secure.\nUnited unveiled the approach in May just weeks before technological glitches grounded its entire fleet twice, underscoring the risks that airlines face. One incident locked the airline out of its reservations system, preventing customers from checking in, and another zapped functionality of the software United needed to dispatch its flight plan.\n\"We believe that this program will further bolster our security and allow us to continue to provide excellent service,\" United said on its website, declining additional comment.\nJordan Wiens, a researcher focused on cyber vulnerabilities, tweeted last week that he received United's top reward of 1 million miles for exposing a flaw that could have allowed hackers to seize control of one of the airline's websites.\n\"It's really interesting that United did what they did,\" he said in an interview. \"There actually aren't that many companies in any industry outside of technology that do bug bounties.\"\nWiens said it was normal for large companies such as United to have bugs in their websites.\nTerms of the agreement prohibit Wiens from disclosing the bug he discovered. The terms also required that Wiens reveal the supposed problem to United without trying to exploit it, meaning he does not know how much information he could have accessed or manipulated.\nBeyond the bounty, United said it tests systems internally and engages cybersecurity firms to keep its websites secure.\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

It can pay compensation to consumers if a financial services firm is unable, or likely to be unable, to pay claims against it. \nThe FSCS received more than 53,000 new claims in 2014/15, broadly the same number as in the previous year, and paid £327m of compensation to 24,000 people. The bill was up from £243m in 2013/14. \nThe increase is attributed to the rise in complaints about self-invested personal pensions (Sipps). \nThe average compensation payment for claims against independent financial advisers relating to Sipps increased by nearly 50pc to £16,375. That compared with last year’s average payment of £11,104. \nThe FSCS said it expects Sipp-related claims to continue to rise in 2015/16. \nA substantial growth in the numbers of new general insurance claims, which rose from 14,328 to 21,900 last year, also contributed to the larger compensation bill. \nThe FSCS can pay compensation to cover deposits in failed banks, building societies and credit unions, as well as insurance and life and pension claims where a policy was mis-sold or a firm is insolvent. \nIt can also cover protection for investments if investors suffer losses due to bad investment advice, poor investment management, fraud, or where a firm cannot return investments or money owed to customers. \nIt does not pay compensation for a financial service product that has not performed as hoped, or for shares in a company that have become worthless following its collapse. \nTell us your story by emailing money@telegraph.co.uk \nShould you complain to the FSCS?

This is the highest quarterly concentrate production since operations began. \nGold concentrate production was 238,000 ounces, more than double the 113,000 ounces in the second quarter of 2014. \nTurquoise Hill repeated its previous forecast for full-year output of 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates. \nIn May, Mongolia and Rio Tinto reached an agreement that paved the way for work to resume on the $5 billion mine that is expected to drive growth for the country and company. A crucial next step for the expansion is securing finance. \nOyu Tolgoi started production in 2013. (Reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; Editing by Toni Reinhold)",

This is the highest quarterly concentrate production since operations began. \nGold concentrate production was 238,000 ounces, more than double the 113,000 ounces in the second quarter of 2014. \nTurquoise Hill repeated its previous forecast for full-year output of 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates. \nIn May, Mongolia and Rio Tinto reached an agreement that paved the way for work to resume on the $5 billion mine that is expected to drive growth for the country and company. A crucial next step for the expansion is securing finance. \nOyu Tolgoi started production in 2013. (Reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; Editing by Toni Reinhold)",

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann \n(Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which is all set to acquire rival BG Group Plc (BG.L), may cut its capital expenditure for the year by several billion dollars from the previously announced $33 billion figure (21 billion pounds), the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing sources. \nA substantial cut to this year's capital investment might be outlined during the company's interim results on July 30, the newspaper said. \nThe paper said the Anglo-Dutch energy company had also told investors that the BG deal works with crude oil at $70 per barrel, citing much greater synergies which will likely exceed several billions, the business daily said. \nThe company told investors that \"value synergies\" are likely to be \"a multiple\" of $1 billion in annual projected savings from merging head offices and other cost-cutting, the FT said. \nShell, which is betting on crude rising to $90 a barrel by 2020, a key assumption in its move to buy rival BG Group, said it expects oil prices to recover gradually over the next five years. \nShell and BG Group could not be reached immediately for comments outside regular business hours.",

Shell discovered weeks ago that the Fennica icebreaker that holds the required equipment, called a capping stack, had a three foot (1 meter) gash in it. \n\"Without the required well control system in place, Shell will not be allowed to drill into oil-bearing zones,\" BSEE Director Brian Salemo said. \nShell last week sent the Fennica, which it is leasing, to Portland, Oregon, for repairs. Fixing the gash and sending it back could take weeks. \nThe company said then it did not expect to require the capping stack until August and that it could proceed with preliminary drilling. Shell did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday. \nEnvironmentalists have criticized Shell's drilling plans in the Arctic, which is home to sensitive populations of whales, walrus and polar bears.

Shell discovered weeks ago that the Fennica icebreaker that holds the required equipment, called a capping stack, had a three foot (1 meter) gash in it. \n\"Without the required well control system in place, Shell will not be allowed to drill into oil-bearing zones,\" BSEE Director Brian Salemo said. \nShell last week sent the Fennica, which it is leasing, to Portland, Oregon, for repairs. Fixing the gash and sending it back could take weeks. \nThe company said then it did not expect to require the capping stack until August and that it could proceed with preliminary drilling. Shell did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday. \nEnvironmentalists have criticized Shell's drilling plans in the Arctic, which is home to sensitive populations of whales, walrus and polar bears.

Headline inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range during the first two quarters of next year, while upside risks posed by the exchange rate have increased.\"\n\"The inflation forecast of the Bank has changed marginally since the previous meeting of the MPC, with headline inflation now expected to average 5.0 percent in 2015, up from 4.9 percent previously.\"\n\"The forecast for the first two quarters of next year has also been revised up by 0.1 percentage points to 6.9 percent and 6.1 per cent respectively, with a return to within the target range by the third quarter.\n\"However, the forecast average inflation for both 2016 and 2017 is unchanged at 6.1 percent and 5.7 percent.\"\nGROWTH\n\"The domestic growth outlook remains subdued amid continued electricity supply constrains and weak business and consumer confidence.\"\n\"The bank's forecast for growth in each year of the forecast period has been revised down marginally, to 2.0 percent in 2015 and 2.1 percent in 2016, and rising to 2.6 percent in 2017 when some easing of the electricity supply constraint is assumed.\" (Reporting by Johannesburg newsroom; Editing by Ed Cropley )",

Headline inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range during the first two quarters of next year, while upside risks posed by the exchange rate have increased.\"\n\"The inflation forecast of the Bank has changed marginally since the previous meeting of the MPC, with headline inflation now expected to average 5.0 percent in 2015, up from 4.9 percent previously.\"\n\"The forecast for the first two quarters of next year has also been revised up by 0.1 percentage points to 6.9 percent and 6.1 per cent respectively, with a return to within the target range by the third quarter.\n\"However, the forecast average inflation for both 2016 and 2017 is unchanged at 6.1 percent and 5.7 percent.\"\nGROWTH\n\"The domestic growth outlook remains subdued amid continued electricity supply constrains and weak business and consumer confidence.\"\n\"The bank's forecast for growth in each year of the forecast period has been revised down marginally, to 2.0 percent in 2015 and 2.1 percent in 2016, and rising to 2.6 percent in 2017 when some easing of the electricity supply constraint is assumed.\" (Reporting by Johannesburg newsroom; Editing by Ed Cropley )",

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.8 percent on Thursday, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased 1.4 percent for a seventh day of gains after Greece’s parliament approved bailout measures and the European Central Bank boosted emergency aid. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.5 percent higher.\n“China worries have died down and Greece is now a non-issue, until September anyway,” said Evan Lucas, Melbourne-based market strategist at LG Ltd. “These points currently give me reason to be more optimistic.”\nECB President Mario Draghi sought to draw a line under the Greek crisis Thursday, confirming the nation’s place in the euro, as the central bank decided to raise funding to its lenders by 900 million euros ($979 million). He also said that Europe’s economic pickup is proceeding and increased uncertainty in financial markets isn’t hindering a broadening of that recovery.\nJapan’s Topix index was little changed and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.1 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.3 percent and South Korea’s Kospi index rose 0.4 percent. Futures on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.5 percent in most recent trading and contracts on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 0.7 percent.\nE-minis on the S&P 500 were little changed. American investors turned to the raft of earnings reports for clues on the health of the world’s largest economy. Netflix Inc. climbed to a record after reporting a jump in subscribers, while Citigroup Inc. and EBay Inc. advanced after disclosing results.",

        "text_full": "Asian Stocks Head for Best Week Since April as Greece Fears Ease\nAsian stocks headed for the biggest weekly gain since April as the increased likelihood of an end to Greece’s debt crisis bolstered global equities.\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded little changed at 144.32 as of 9:03 a.m. in Tokyo, heading for a 2.3 percent advance this week. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.8 percent on Thursday, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased 1.4 percent for a seventh day of gains after Greece’s parliament approved bailout measures and the European Central Bank boosted emergency aid. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.5 percent higher.\n“China worries have died down and Greece is now a non-issue, until September anyway,” said Evan Lucas, Melbourne-based market strategist at LG Ltd. “These points currently give me reason to be more optimistic.”\nECB President Mario Draghi sought to draw a line under the Greek crisis Thursday, confirming the nation’s place in the euro, as the central bank decided to raise funding to its lenders by 900 million euros ($979 million). He also said that Europe’s economic pickup is proceeding and increased uncertainty in financial markets isn’t hindering a broadening of that recovery.\nJapan’s Topix index was little changed and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.1 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.3 percent and South Korea’s Kospi index rose 0.4 percent. Futures on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.5 percent in most recent trading and contracts on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 0.7 percent.\nE-minis on the S&P 500 were little changed. American investors turned to the raft of earnings reports for clues on the health of the world’s largest economy. Netflix Inc. climbed to a record after reporting a jump in subscribers, while Citigroup Inc. and EBay Inc. advanced after disclosing results.",

Finance Minister Sommai \nPhasee denied reports in local media that he had resigned. ( http://bit.ly/1HSVuH5 ) \n\"The cabinet reshuffle is a hot topic. If the cabinet really \nis reshuffled, we believe it will help boost investor \nconfidence. The reshuffle will also allow pending plans to \nprogress,\" said broker Maybank Kim Eng Securities in a report. \nSingapore's key Straits Times Index was up 0.3 \npercent after Wednesday's second straight fall to a near \none-week low. Singapore Telecommunications, the most \nactively traded by turnover, rose 0.9 percent. \nThe June inflation figures would provide indications over \nSingapore's central bank's policy stance, brokers said. A \nReuters poll showed Singapore's consumer price index probably \nfell for the eighth straight month in June. \nIndexes of Malaysia, Indonesia and the \nPhilppines were nearly flat as Asian shares dipped on \nThursday following Wall Street's decline overnight and \nlacklustre regional data. \nVietnam's benchmark rose 0.4 percent after a 2.2 \npercent jump on Wednesday.",

Finance Minister Sommai \nPhasee denied reports in local media that he had resigned. ( http://bit.ly/1HSVuH5 ) \n\"The cabinet reshuffle is a hot topic. If the cabinet really \nis reshuffled, we believe it will help boost investor \nconfidence. The reshuffle will also allow pending plans to \nprogress,\" said broker Maybank Kim Eng Securities in a report. \nSingapore's key Straits Times Index was up 0.3 \npercent after Wednesday's second straight fall to a near \none-week low. Singapore Telecommunications, the most \nactively traded by turnover, rose 0.9 percent. \nThe June inflation figures would provide indications over \nSingapore's central bank's policy stance, brokers said. A \nReuters poll showed Singapore's consumer price index probably \nfell for the eighth straight month in June. \nIndexes of Malaysia, Indonesia and the \nPhilppines were nearly flat as Asian shares dipped on \nThursday following Wall Street's decline overnight and \nlacklustre regional data. \nVietnam's benchmark rose 0.4 percent after a 2.2 \npercent jump on Wednesday.",

A day earlier, London appeared to rule out lending to Greece from the EFSM, run by all 28 EU states not just the 19-member euro zone.\nOne EU official said a possible solution was to give Britain, and other non-euro zone states like Poland, guarantees of repayment on their contribution to the EFSM from money held at the European Central Bank related to past purchases of Greek government bonds. This money is known as Greece's SMP profits. (Reporting by Alastair Macdonald ; @macdonaldrtr; editing by Philip Blenkinsop )",

Coal exports have also been hurt by the strong U.S. dollar.\nIn the third quarter of 2014, CSX reported earnings per share of 51 cents. The Jacksonville, Florida-based company said a recent train derailment in Maryville, Tennessee, should have around a penny impact on the quarter's earnings.\nThousands of Maryville residents were evacuated earlier this month after a train carrying chemicals derailed and caught fire.\nCSX reported earnings late Tuesday that beat market expectations despite lower coal volumes that pushed revenue down 6 percent. The company benefited in the quarter from a lower fuel bill and improved productivity.\nDuring a conference call Wednesday, CSX executives said the company also benefited from price increases during the quarter of 3.9 percent, or 3.5 percent excluding its declining coal business.

They have long pushed for the sharing of airline passenger data. \nBut members of the European Parliament have resisted for two years, on the grounds that would infringe people's privacy. \nThe Islamist attacks on French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January pushed the issue up on the agenda, and on Wednesday members of the Civil Liberties Committee in the European Parliament voted for an amended version of the so-called \"Passenger Name Record\" proposal. \nIt will now be fine-tuned in negotiations with member states before becoming law. \n\"The emerging threat posed by so-called 'foreign fighters' has made this system even more essential,\" said British Conservative MEP Timothy Kirkhope, who is spearheading the proposal. \nThe system would make airlines operating flights into and out of the EU - but not within the EU - hand over passenger data such as seat numbers, contact details, itineraries and payment information, to EU law enforcement authorities, who will comb through them to identify patterns of suspicious behaviour. \nLawmakers narrowed the types of crimes for which the data can be used to terrorism offences and some types of serious transnational crime, such as people trafficking and child abduction. \nThe data would be \"masked out\" after 30 days to prevent the passenger being identified. It can then be held for up to five years for terrorism offences and four years for transnational crimes. \nLiberals and Greens in the Parliament still condemned the proposal, saying blanket collection of data would do nothing to stop terrorists from entering the EU. \nThey had supported a targeted system of data collection which they say would have ensured a better balance between security and privacy, a debate that has heated up as Western governments have sought to counter the radicalisation on the Internet. \n(Reporting by Julia Fioretti; Editing by Larry King)",

More than three stocks declined for each that rose on the gauge.

These remedies address the concerns of the Commission and at the same time preserve the economic and strategic value of the deal,\" the company said in a statement. \nThe concessions will have to address the European Commission's worries that the deal could hurt competition as it would result in the merged gas turbine company competing with only German rival Siemens (SIEGn.DE). \nThe EU competition authority is likely to extend its scrutiny to mid-September from Aug. 21 as it seeks feedback from rivals such as Siemens, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, Toshiba Corp , Italian company Ansaldo (STS.MI) and customers. \nSelling off some of Alstom's intellectual property or physical equipment lines would be considered limited concessions to win EU approval, Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker said in a research note last month. \nGE has drawn the line against divesting anything that would hurt business gained from servicing gas turbines, which generate lucrative revenues. \nGE got a taste of how tough EU regulators could be in 2001 when they rejected its planned $42 billion takeover of Honeywell International (HON.N) despite the green light from U.S. authorities. \nHowever, this time a veto is seen as unlikely as it could stir up a political storm in France and the United States. \n($1 = 0.9195 euros)",

Learn more... \nFri, Jul 17, 2015, 00:50 BST - UK Markets open in 7 hrs 10 mins GE offers concessions in bid for EU clearance of Alstom deal Reuters – 1 hour 7 minutes ago \nThe logo of Alstom is pictured on a building during an inaugural visit of the Alstom offshore wind turbine … By Foo Yun Chee \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate General Electric (GE.N) has offered concessions in an attempt to counter EU regulatory concerns about its 12.4-billion-euro ($13.49 billion) bid for French peer Alstom's power unit, its biggest ever acquisition. \nThe company submitted its proposal on Thursday but did not provide details. \n\"GE confirms it has submitted remedies to the European Commission in relation to the GE-Alstom transaction. These remedies address the concerns of the Commission and at the same time preserve the economic and strategic value of the deal,\" the company said in a statement. \nThe concessions will have to address the European Commission's worries that the deal could hurt competition as it would result in the merged gas turbine company competing with only German rival Siemens (SIEGn.DE). \nThe EU competition authority is likely to extend its scrutiny to mid-September from Aug. 21 as it seeks feedback from rivals such as Siemens, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, Toshiba Corp , Italian company Ansaldo (STS.MI) and customers. \nSelling off some of Alstom's intellectual property or physical equipment lines would be considered limited concessions to win EU approval, Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker said in a research note last month. \nGE has drawn the line against divesting anything that would hurt business gained from servicing gas turbines, which generate lucrative revenues. \nGE got a taste of how tough EU regulators could be in 2001 when they rejected its planned $42 billion takeover of Honeywell International (HON.N) despite the green light from U.S. authorities. \nHowever, this time a veto is seen as unlikely as it could stir up a political storm in France and the United States. \n($1 = 0.9195 euros)",

        "text_full": "UK's Cameron to demand opt-out of EU employment laws - media\nPrint \nLONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to be able to opt out of some EU employment legislation as part of his renegotiation with Brussels, media reports said on Saturday. \nCameron has embarked on a drive to renegotiate the country's relationship with the EU on issues such as welfare, migration and competitiveness before holding an in/out referendum before the end of 2017. \nOn Saturday the Telegraph and Times newspapers said, as part of the talks, Cameron would call for the right to control Britain's employment laws, including rules on working time limits and equal rights for temporary workers. \n\"This is just more of the speculation we said there would be during the negotiation,\" a spokeswoman for Cameron's Downing Street office said. \n\"The prime minister has ... made clear that cutting back on unnecessary EU regulation is part of making Europe more competitive.\" \nCameron's bid to reshape Britain's relationship with Europe has so far focused mainly on limiting welfare benefits for migrants, leaving some eurosceptic members of his party to complain that the prime minister was not being ambitious enough in his demands. \nBritain had previously secured the right to opt out of some legislation covering social and employment rules, but this was given up by former Prime Minister Tony Blair. \nThe opposition Labour party, which is generally more pro-European, said the mooted demands appeared to be aimed at keeping Cameron's Conservative Party happy, rather than improving Britain's relationship with the EU. \n\"Tearing up rights at work is no basis for winning support to stay in a reformed EU, which is what the prime minister claims is his objective,\" said Pat McFadden, Labour's spokesman for Europe.

Things have gotten very cheap in the last few days.”\nThomas said that his wealthy individual and family office clients indicated in conversations this week that they wanted to deposit more money in the Wykeham Capital Asia Value Fund even as it lost 16.3 percent so far this month.\nWykeham has made a one-time arrangement to accept additional capital on July 15, according to a letter to investors Wednesday. It usually allows subscriptions and redemptions only at the end of the month, said Thomas.\nThe hedge fund, which had about $24 million of assets at the beginning of July, is focused on Hong Kong-listed stocks with a market value of less than $500 million, he said.\nThe MSCI Hong Kong Small Cap Index dropped 7.4 percent on Wednesday, the most since October 2008, and was down 21 percent this month to yesterday. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has tumbled 31 percent from a June 12 high as Chinese government support measures failed to allay concern that margin trades will keep unwinding at a record pace.\n‘Nasty Effect’ “The turmoil from the Greek referendum and the collapse of stock markets in China is having a nasty effect on the valuations of most Hong Kong listed small-cap companies,” Thomas wrote in the letter to investors.\nJuly’s share price declines cut the estimated price-earnings multiple of the MSCI small-cap gauge to 7.5 times, compared to a five-year average of 13 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThomas, who was an equity-derivatives banker during his stint at CLSA, began trading with his own money in April 2009, and started a $1 million fund in October 2010.\nThe fund has gained 16.5 percent this year after the July loss eroded a 39 percent return in the first six months, he said in the letter.

It encouraged banks to offer loans to China Securities Finance Corp., an agency that helps to supply credit for stock purchases.\nOne of the side-effects of the stock market’s collapse from a June 12 peak was to diminish the value of shares pledged as collateral for loans from banks and brokerages. As of Wednesday, that pool of stock was valued at 1.9 trillion yuan ($306 billion) and comprised shares in 1,170 companies, according to Wind Information data.\n“The bottom line for the government is to prevent contagion to the banking system, which can lead to systemic risks,” said Zheng Chunming, a Shanghai-based banking and brokerage analyst at Capital Securities Corp. “Some stocks have tumbled more than 60 percent, any further drop will start to hurt banks’ financial health no matter how low the leverage is.”\nThe Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8 percent as of 10:29 a.m. local time.",

It encouraged banks to offer loans to China Securities Finance Corp., an agency that helps to supply credit for stock purchases.\nOne of the side-effects of the stock market’s collapse from a June 12 peak was to diminish the value of shares pledged as collateral for loans from banks and brokerages. As of Wednesday, that pool of stock was valued at 1.9 trillion yuan ($306 billion) and comprised shares in 1,170 companies, according to Wind Information data.\n“The bottom line for the government is to prevent contagion to the banking system, which can lead to systemic risks,” said Zheng Chunming, a Shanghai-based banking and brokerage analyst at Capital Securities Corp. “Some stocks have tumbled more than 60 percent, any further drop will start to hurt banks’ financial health no matter how low the leverage is.”\nThe Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8 percent as of 10:29 a.m. local time.",

        "text": "NEW YORK, July 24 Verizon Communication Inc's wireline unit workers on the U.S. East Coast have voted to go on strike, if needed, amid contract negotiations, the unions representing them said on Saturday.\nAt a rally in New York, the unions announced that 86 percent of Verizon's 39,000 wireline employees have voted to authorize a strike. This comes a week before their current contracts expire on Aug. 1.\nThe vote to strike does not mean work in the wireline business, which includes FiOS Internet, telephone and TV services, will come to a halt as the board of the unions Communications Workers of America (CWA) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that represent the employees have yet to approve it.\n\"Our members are clear and they are determined - they reject management's harsh concessionary demands, including the elimination of job security, sharp increases in workers' health care costs, and slashing retirement security,\" Vice President for CWA District One Dennis Trainor said in a statement.\nThe company's union-represented employees in the East work under 27 collective bargaining agreements in nine eastern states in the United States and Washington D.C. Verizon's plans to cut costs by conrolling healthcare and pension-related benefits over a three-year period are at the center of union negotiations.\n\"Union rallies and strike authorization votes are useless distractions that achieve nothing,\" Verizon spokesman Rich Young said. \"We believe their time would be far more beneficial focusing on the important contractual issues that need to be resolved.\"\nVerizon said in late June it offered salary hikes to 39,000 employees in its East wireline business after its first negotiating session with representatives of the two unions.\nThe wage increases were subject to an agreement between the company and the unions. In 2011, the last round of talks had ended in a strike. (Reporting by Malathi Nayak)",

        "text_full": "Verizon wireline workers authorize strike amid contract negotiations\nNEW YORK, July 24 Verizon Communication Inc's wireline unit workers on the U.S. East Coast have voted to go on strike, if needed, amid contract negotiations, the unions representing them said on Saturday.\nAt a rally in New York, the unions announced that 86 percent of Verizon's 39,000 wireline employees have voted to authorize a strike. This comes a week before their current contracts expire on Aug. 1.\nThe vote to strike does not mean work in the wireline business, which includes FiOS Internet, telephone and TV services, will come to a halt as the board of the unions Communications Workers of America (CWA) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that represent the employees have yet to approve it.\n\"Our members are clear and they are determined - they reject management's harsh concessionary demands, including the elimination of job security, sharp increases in workers' health care costs, and slashing retirement security,\" Vice President for CWA District One Dennis Trainor said in a statement.\nThe company's union-represented employees in the East work under 27 collective bargaining agreements in nine eastern states in the United States and Washington D.C. Verizon's plans to cut costs by conrolling healthcare and pension-related benefits over a three-year period are at the center of union negotiations.\n\"Union rallies and strike authorization votes are useless distractions that achieve nothing,\" Verizon spokesman Rich Young said. \"We believe their time would be far more beneficial focusing on the important contractual issues that need to be resolved.\"\nVerizon said in late June it offered salary hikes to 39,000 employees in its East wireline business after its first negotiating session with representatives of the two unions.\nThe wage increases were subject to an agreement between the company and the unions. In 2011, the last round of talks had ended in a strike. (Reporting by Malathi Nayak)",

The company today reiterated its 2015 sales and earnings targets, including its goal for cloud and on-premises software revenue growth.\nThe weakening value of the euro has helped SAP’s results, as it translates overseas sales into its home currency.

        "text": "NAIROBI, July 20 The Kenyan shilling was a touch weaker in early trading on Monday due to spillover demand for dollars from last week as traders eyed possible central bank action to stem the shilling's depreciation. The shilling, which has lost about 14 percent against the U.S. currency this year, was trading at 102.65/75 to the dollar at 0700 GMT, compared with 102.45/55 at Friday's close. \"Last week there was dollar demand from large private equity ... and there are remnants of that demand weakening the shilling,\" said a trader at one Nairobi-based commercial bank. He added that the focus for the rest of the trading session will be on the central bank, which last week said that it was monitoring the currency closely and was ready to step up its activities \"to stem a sharp depreciation\". The bank has already boosted interest rates by three percentage points to 11.5 percent since June and intervened at least three times last week to sell dollars to support the shilling. The next Monetary Policy Committee meeting is on Aug. 5. The shilling has been under pressure from the global strength of the dollar, a slide in valuable tourism revenue and a widening current account deficit. Traders say the shilling's slide will be checked by the rising rates on the overnight borrowing market for banks, where the average weighted interest rate rose to 13.6 percent on Friday from 12.8 percent a day earlier.

Analysts and investors hoped she would help rein in costs from non-profitable projects such as those from the Google X lab, which has experimented with Google Glass and the self-driving car.\nGoogle's shares started rising after the company reported higher-than-expected earnings for the first time in six quarters.\nAlso boosting the stock were Porat's comments in a prepared statement that said the company was focused on developing \"big new opportunities\" while doing so \"with great care regarding resource allocation.\"\nBefore the call, shares were up roughly 7 percent. In the course of the call the shares rose roughly 12 percent. Late in the day shares were up a little over 11 percent, at $671, after closing at $601.78 on the Nasdaq.\nThat would represent an all-time high for the stock in regular trading if it closes at that level on Friday, adding roughly $40 billion to its market value.\nOn the analyst call, Porat continually emphasized operating costs that were growing more slowly and declining expenses that reflected increased discipline in the managing of expenses.\n\"The profitability of our business gives us many opportunities, but the main point is today the biggest return on investment has been in our core search business,\" Porat said.\nAnalysts said Google has made it clear in recent quarters that it would work to tighten spending but that Porat's comments indicated she would help push the company to control costs further.\n\"She will likely look at ways to optimize that, particularly as new products and emerging products grow,\" said Kerry Rice, analyst at Needham & Co, adding that Porat would be able to help incrementally improve Google's cost control measures.\nPorat also told investors and analysts, \"I am committed to being direct with you.\"\n(Editing by Stephen R.
