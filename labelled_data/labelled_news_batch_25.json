Vice’s London arm, based in Shoreditch, the epicentre of the so-called 'hipster’ culture the company chronicles, is however in the midst of commissioning full-length documentary series from established third-party British producers and directors intended to run on the channel. \nThe British channel would be Vice’s third after the US and Canada, its home market. \nVice also provides material to other broadcasters in several European countries and programmes are shared across the network. It has previously sought to break into the UK television market via a partnership with Channel 4 News (Other OTC: NWSAL - news ) but is now preparing its own channel. \nThe company grew out of a magazine founded in Montreal in 1994 but is now primarily focused on video. Alongside edgy online coverage on subjects such as recreational drug use and fringe politics Vice has pioneered the market for sponsored videos, whereby brands support commissioning and pay for production. \nThe model has attracted interest from the media and advertising establishment. News Corp and WPP (LSE: WPP.L - news ) have been involved in a series of funding rounds that have pushed its valuation to $2.5bn . \nThe most recent accounts available for the UK arm, for 2013, reported a pre-tax profit of £3m on sales of £38.2m. The 2014 accounts are overdue, according to Companies House. \nA spokesman for Vice said suggestions it will launch a UK channel next year were “speculation”.",

Vice’s London arm, based in Shoreditch, the epicentre of the so-called 'hipster’ culture the company chronicles, is however in the midst of commissioning full-length documentary series from established third-party British producers and directors intended to run on the channel. \nThe British channel would be Vice’s third after the US and Canada, its home market. \nVice also provides material to other broadcasters in several European countries and programmes are shared across the network. It has previously sought to break into the UK television market via a partnership with Channel 4 News (Other OTC: NWSAL - news ) but is now preparing its own channel. \nThe company grew out of a magazine founded in Montreal in 1994 but is now primarily focused on video. Alongside edgy online coverage on subjects such as recreational drug use and fringe politics Vice has pioneered the market for sponsored videos, whereby brands support commissioning and pay for production. \nThe model has attracted interest from the media and advertising establishment. News Corp and WPP (LSE: WPP.L - news ) have been involved in a series of funding rounds that have pushed its valuation to $2.5bn . \nThe most recent accounts available for the UK arm, for 2013, reported a pre-tax profit of £3m on sales of £38.2m. The 2014 accounts are overdue, according to Companies House. \nA spokesman for Vice said suggestions it will launch a UK channel next year were “speculation”.",

But Berlin wants to be prepared for cost cuts at Volkswagen. \nA government spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. \nWorks council head Bernd Osterloh had said earlier this month it was not yet clear whether the emissions scandal would affect jobs over the medium to longer term. \"At this point, there are no consequences for jobs, neither for core workers nor for temporary staff.\" \n($1 = 0.8814 euros) (Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz; Writing by Paul Carrel and Arno Schuetze; Editing by David Holmes)",

But Berlin wants to be prepared for cost cuts at Volkswagen. \nA government spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. \nWorks council head Bernd Osterloh had said earlier this month it was not yet clear whether the emissions scandal would affect jobs over the medium to longer term. \"At this point, there are no consequences for jobs, neither for core workers nor for temporary staff.\" \n($1 = 0.8814 euros) (Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz; Writing by Paul Carrel and Arno Schuetze; Editing by David Holmes)",

Steel Crisis Worsens As 1,800 Jobs Threatened By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 7 minutes ago View Photo \n\nUp to 1,800 more UK steel industry jobs are set to go as the axe falls on 20 sites across the country. \nUK-based steel firm Caparo is the latest victim of the global steel crisis as it is set to enter administration. \nThe announcement looks set to bring the total recent job losses related to the steel industry to 5,300 after redundancies at Redcar, Scunthorpe and Scotland earlier this month. \nThe company, which is owned by Labour peer Lord Paul, produces a number of steel products. \nDue to overcapacity in the Chinese market the price of steel has fallen by 40% from around £318 a ton to under £191 in the past year, meaning that domestic firms are no longer able to compete. \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) sources have said that administrator PwC is looking for buyers for the business, but prospects are bleak given the failure to find a buyer for the Redcar steel works. \nCaparo Industries reported a £0.8m operating loss in 2014, down from a profit of £3.1m in the prior year. \nAngela Eagle, shadow business secretary, said: \"With the Chinese president in the UK this week, I hope the Government will raise the issue of anti-competitive dumping which is driving down steel prices.\" \nThe Government held a summit last week to address the future of the ailing UK steel industry. \nThe economic slowdown in China has weighed on steel demand with volumes down 4% last year and likely to be 5-6% lower this year, according to Richard White at the International Steel Statistics Bureau. \nThis translates to a huge glut of Chinese steel which is no longer required domestically, prompting Chinese steel exports to double in 2014. \nThis means that China is now exporting 100 million tons of steel per year at prices which are below the Chinese cost of production, let alone the costs associated with UK steel production. \nThe majority of Chinese steel makers are currently loss making, with very few mills refusing to cut production and even fewer considering shut down.",

Steel Crisis Worsens As 1,800 Jobs Threatened By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 7 minutes ago View Photo \n\nUp to 1,800 more UK steel industry jobs are set to go as the axe falls on 20 sites across the country. \nUK-based steel firm Caparo is the latest victim of the global steel crisis as it is set to enter administration. \nThe announcement looks set to bring the total recent job losses related to the steel industry to 5,300 after redundancies at Redcar, Scunthorpe and Scotland earlier this month. \nThe company, which is owned by Labour peer Lord Paul, produces a number of steel products. \nDue to overcapacity in the Chinese market the price of steel has fallen by 40% from around £318 a ton to under £191 in the past year, meaning that domestic firms are no longer able to compete. \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) sources have said that administrator PwC is looking for buyers for the business, but prospects are bleak given the failure to find a buyer for the Redcar steel works. \nCaparo Industries reported a £0.8m operating loss in 2014, down from a profit of £3.1m in the prior year. \nAngela Eagle, shadow business secretary, said: \"With the Chinese president in the UK this week, I hope the Government will raise the issue of anti-competitive dumping which is driving down steel prices.\" \nThe Government held a summit last week to address the future of the ailing UK steel industry. \nThe economic slowdown in China has weighed on steel demand with volumes down 4% last year and likely to be 5-6% lower this year, according to Richard White at the International Steel Statistics Bureau. \nThis translates to a huge glut of Chinese steel which is no longer required domestically, prompting Chinese steel exports to double in 2014. \nThis means that China is now exporting 100 million tons of steel per year at prices which are below the Chinese cost of production, let alone the costs associated with UK steel production. \nThe majority of Chinese steel makers are currently loss making, with very few mills refusing to cut production and even fewer considering shut down.",

It   moves Paragon Bank into a profitable position and gives it a platform for growth in a large complementary product area,\" added the analysts, who have a 'buy' recommendation on Paragon's stock and a 540 pence price target. \nShares in Paragon, which owns Paragon Bank, were up 8.9 percent at 430 pence at 0906 GMT - the leading gainers on the FTSE Mid-Cap index and on course to post their biggest daily gain in four years. \nFive Arrows Leasing provides asset finance services for industries including printing, construction and engineering. For the year to end-March, it generated net banking income of 28.5 million pounds and at end-March had net assets of 42.9 million pounds, Rothschild said in a statement. \nRothschild said the sale was in line with its plan to focus on financial advisory, wealth and asset management and merchant banking, and that the Five Arrows brand was not included in the deal, which is expected to close in November. \n($1 = 0.6598 pounds) (Reporting by Simon Jessop; Editing by Pravin Char)",

        "text": "(Adds pipeline ownership, blast details)\nOct 9 (Reuters) - Williams Cos Inc on Friday delayed the return to service date for the Southeast Louisiana Lateral pipeline after an explosion and fire in Gibson, Louisiana, killed three workers on Thursday.\nWilliams spokesman Chris Stockton said the line was shut on Oct. 4 for planned maintenance and had been expected to return to service on Oct. 12 before the blast.\nHe said the return to service date was now \"to be determined.\"\nBefore the maintenance outage, which shut the entire Southeast Louisiana Lateral, about 190 million cubic feet of gas per day flowed through the line. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to meet the needs of about 10,000 U.S. homes for a year.\nThe pipeline gathers gas from the Gulf of Mexico and transports it onshore for processing, Stockton said.\nThe pipeline is owned by Williams Partners' Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Co (Transco).\nWilliams said service to customers was not interrupted because no gas was flowing through the pipeline at the time of the blast. The company said the pipeline did not rupture.\nPersonnel were performing maintenance on a piece of equipment in the station yard called a \"slug catcher\" which is used to collect hydrocarbon liquids and other impurities from the gas stream.\nThree contractors performing the maintenance died and two others sustained serious injuries, Williams said in a statement.\nThe 13 Williams employees stationed at the facility have been accounted for and were not injured, the company said.\n\"We are deeply saddened by reports of serious injuries to personnel working at the scene. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families at this very critical time,\" said Warren Toups, Williams Operations Manager.\nThe building containing the compressor engines was not damaged, the company said.

One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to meet the needs of about 10,000 U.S. homes for a year.\nThe pipeline gathers gas from the Gulf of Mexico and transports it onshore for processing, Stockton said.\nThe pipeline is owned by Williams Partners' Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Co (Transco).\nWilliams said service to customers was not interrupted because no gas was flowing through the pipeline at the time of the blast. The company said the pipeline did not rupture.\nPersonnel were performing maintenance on a piece of equipment in the station yard called a \"slug catcher\" which is used to collect hydrocarbon liquids and other impurities from the gas stream.\nThree contractors performing the maintenance died and two others sustained serious injuries, Williams said in a statement.\nThe 13 Williams employees stationed at the facility have been accounted for and were not injured, the company said.\n\"We are deeply saddened by reports of serious injuries to personnel working at the scene. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families at this very critical time,\" said Warren Toups, Williams Operations Manager.\nThe building containing the compressor engines was not damaged, the company said.

Treasuries and German government bonds since September, particularly in the run-up to the syndication. \n\"The demand is pretty strong. We were sort of expecting that because the sector had cheapened quite a lot and there are plenty of reasons why one should be involved at the long end of the curve,\" said Vatsala Datta, UK rate strategist at RBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) . \n\"By any measure, this is a pretty big book size and unsurprisingly the DMO (Debt Management Office) has upped the target as well.\" \nThe syndication needed to raise around 4.5 billion pounds to meet the debt agency's target for conventional bond issuance via syndication for the 2015/16 financial year. \nThe bookrunners on the deal are BofA Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) and Santander. \n($1 = 0.6456 pounds) (Reporting by Ana Nicolaci da Costa; editing by William Schomberg)",

Treasuries and German government bonds since September, particularly in the run-up to the syndication. \n\"The demand is pretty strong. We were sort of expecting that because the sector had cheapened quite a lot and there are plenty of reasons why one should be involved at the long end of the curve,\" said Vatsala Datta, UK rate strategist at RBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) . \n\"By any measure, this is a pretty big book size and unsurprisingly the DMO (Debt Management Office) has upped the target as well.\" \nThe syndication needed to raise around 4.5 billion pounds to meet the debt agency's target for conventional bond issuance via syndication for the 2015/16 financial year. \nThe bookrunners on the deal are BofA Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) and Santander. \n($1 = 0.6456 pounds) (Reporting by Ana Nicolaci da Costa; editing by William Schomberg)",

But residents as far south as Humacao, near the southwestern corner of the island, told Reuters they had been without power.\nThe initial 147,000 represented about 4 percent of the island's roughly 3.5 million population.\nThe affected lines included a pair of 230-kilovolt lines, one linking the municipalities of Manati and Bayamon, in the north, the other between the Aguirre and Costa Sur power plants, in the south. The other two affected lines were 115-kilovolt transmissions, one linking Manati and Vega Baja, also in the north, and the other running between the major city Ponce and Santa Isabel, in the south.\nBayamon is close to San Juan, the island's capital city and business hub. Echevarria said he had no information as to whether business operations were significantly affected, but said PREPA had not heard serious complaints from businesses on the island.\nIn PREPA's statement saying power had been restored, which came around 3:30 p.m (1930 GMT) on Friday, PREPA Deputy Director Carlos Castro praised a \"rapid response\" from agency staff.\nPREPA \"has reserves and sufficient generation capacity to avoid the risk of blackouts and ensure continuity of service,\" Castro said in the statement.\nPREPA is struggling with more than $8 billion in debt. It is working to finalize a debt restructuring deal with creditors, which in turn have demanded operational overhauls that could cause PREPA to raise electricity rates and invest in improving outdated infrastructure.

The contract rose $1.72 to close at $53.05 a barrel on Thursday. \nU.S. crude was 12 cents higher at $49.55 a barrel, after rising 3.4 percent to close at $49.43 a barrel. \nU.S. crude is heading for a gain of nearly 9 percent this week, the biggest weekly increase since August. \nPIRA Energy Group, a closely watched forecaster that predicted the slump in oil prices a year ago, said on Thursday it expects crude prices to rise to $70 per barrel by the end of 2016 and $75 a barrel in 2017. \nAlso supporting prices was the release of the Fed minutes, which showed that policymakers are concerned that the global economic slowdown may affect the outlook for the U.S. \nThis led investors to further pare bets that the Fed is likely to raise rates later rather than sooner. \nGains in Chinese equities on Thursday, opening after a week long National Day holiday, added to the bullish tone, while Russia's military involvement in Syria has brought a geopolitical risk premium into the market. \n(Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Richard Pullin; Editing by Richard Pullin)",

Learn more... \nFri, Oct 9, 2015, 03:02 BST - UK Markets open in 4 hrs 58 mins Crude oil futures rise after bullish forecast, Fed minutes Reuters – 44 minutes ago Print \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Crude oil futures rose in early Asian trade on thin volumes after an influential forecaster predicted that a market rally was not far off and U.S. Federal Reserve minutes suggested there was no hurry to raise rates. \nThe gains added to a surge in prices on Thursday, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, on track for a near 11 percent gain this week, the biggest weekly rise since early 2009. \nBrent was up 20 cents at $53.25 a barrel at 0059 GMT. The contract rose $1.72 to close at $53.05 a barrel on Thursday. \nU.S. crude was 12 cents higher at $49.55 a barrel, after rising 3.4 percent to close at $49.43 a barrel. \nU.S. crude is heading for a gain of nearly 9 percent this week, the biggest weekly increase since August. \nPIRA Energy Group, a closely watched forecaster that predicted the slump in oil prices a year ago, said on Thursday it expects crude prices to rise to $70 per barrel by the end of 2016 and $75 a barrel in 2017. \nAlso supporting prices was the release of the Fed minutes, which showed that policymakers are concerned that the global economic slowdown may affect the outlook for the U.S. \nThis led investors to further pare bets that the Fed is likely to raise rates later rather than sooner. \nGains in Chinese equities on Thursday, opening after a week long National Day holiday, added to the bullish tone, while Russia's military involvement in Syria has brought a geopolitical risk premium into the market. \n(Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Richard Pullin; Editing by Richard Pullin)",

The Belfast-based broadcaster - which produces some of Northern Ireland's most popular shows - has struggled in recent months. \nThe company launched its nationwide UTV Ireland station in January. But it has had a disappointing start, reporting half-year losses of £7.5m this year. The group as a whole, UTV Media (LSE: UTV.L - news ) , reported pre-tax profits £5.5m last year. \nITV's acquisition cements its shift in focus from reality television and entertainment producers in the US, to drama and factual programme makers in the UK If approved, ITV will own 13 of the 15 regional licences for the Channel 3 network across the UK. \nChief executive Adam Crozier said: \"We are pleased that they are joining the ITV family. \n\"We have a long-standing relationship with UTV, which has been the leading commercial broadcaster in Northern Ireland for many years thanks to its strong regional identity and blend of excellent local programming\". \nJohn McCann, chief executive of UTV Media, said: \"Becoming part of the ITV Family is by far the best way to take UTV's television business forward with an ongoing focus to provide brilliant television to viewers right across Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) .\"",

Learn more... \nMon, Oct 19, 2015, 09:29 BST - UK Markets close in 7 hrs 1 mins ITV strikes £100m deal to buy up Northern Ireland's UTV television business By Mehreen Khan | Telegraph – 15 minutes ago 180.75 +7.2500 \nCommercial broadcaster acquires the brand to cement its move to drama and factual programmes made in Britain \nITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) has agreed a £100m deal to buy the UTV media brand - Northern Ireland's most-watched television channel. \nBritain's biggest commercial broadcaster said the move would allow it to expand its \"free to air business\" and would lead to efficiency savings across its network. \nThe deal, which does not include UTV's radio arms, is still subject to approval from regulator Ofcom and Irish competition authorities. \nUTV confirmed in August that it was in discussions regarding the sale of its television assets. The Belfast-based broadcaster - which produces some of Northern Ireland's most popular shows - has struggled in recent months. \nThe company launched its nationwide UTV Ireland station in January. But it has had a disappointing start, reporting half-year losses of £7.5m this year. The group as a whole, UTV Media (LSE: UTV.L - news ) , reported pre-tax profits £5.5m last year. \nITV's acquisition cements its shift in focus from reality television and entertainment producers in the US, to drama and factual programme makers in the UK If approved, ITV will own 13 of the 15 regional licences for the Channel 3 network across the UK. \nChief executive Adam Crozier said: \"We are pleased that they are joining the ITV family. \n\"We have a long-standing relationship with UTV, which has been the leading commercial broadcaster in Northern Ireland for many years thanks to its strong regional identity and blend of excellent local programming\". \nJohn McCann, chief executive of UTV Media, said: \"Becoming part of the ITV Family is by far the best way to take UTV's television business forward with an ongoing focus to provide brilliant television to viewers right across Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) .\"",

It had earlier forecast sales of $43.5 billion-$45 billion.\nAnalysts on average had expected 2015 sales of $44.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFor the quarter ended Sept. 27, total net sales rose to $11.46 billion from $11.11 billion a year earlier.\nNet income fell to $865 million, or $2.77 per share, in the third quarter, from $888 million, or $2.76 per share, a year earlier.\nAnalysts on average had expected a third-quarter profit of $2.72 per share on revenue $11.14 billion.\nUp to Monday's close, Lockheed's stock had risen 9.4 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index.

It had earlier forecast sales of $43.5 billion-$45 billion.\nAnalysts on average had expected 2015 sales of $44.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFor the quarter ended Sept. 27, total net sales rose to $11.46 billion from $11.11 billion a year earlier.\nNet income fell to $865 million, or $2.77 per share, in the third quarter, from $888 million, or $2.76 per share, a year earlier.\nAnalysts on average had expected a third-quarter profit of $2.72 per share on revenue $11.14 billion.\nUp to Monday's close, Lockheed's stock had risen 9.4 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index.

        "text": "Puerto Rico’s main electricity provider is confident it will reach a deal with insurance companies that guarantee repayment on a portion of its $8.3 billion of debt, the utility’s chief restructuring officer said.\nPuerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, is in discussions with insurance companies that guarantee debt on how to reduce its obligations and rehabilitate a system that relies heavily on crude oil to produce electricity. A forbearance agreement with some bondholders and fuel lenders expires Thursday night, unless the parties extend that deadline. The contract keeps restructuring talks out of court. Bondholders and fuel lenders last month agreed to a tentative plan that would include a 15 percent loss.\n“I am confident we will come to an agreement with the monolines,” Lisa Donahue, Prepa’s chief restructuring officer, said Tuesday at a meeting organized by Puerto Rico’s Chamber of Commerce in San Juan. “The solution with the monolines is much more complicated. Their model is cash out, while the bondholders are more inclined to cut losses.”\nPrepa, bondholders, insurance companies and fuel lenders have been in negotiations since August 2014. The utility has improved its operations during that time. Donahue expects to reduce recurring expenses by as much as $390 million through fuel improvements and changes to customer management. Prepa has already achieved $106 million of recurring savings and another $80 million in one-time savings, Donahue said.\nBond insurers MBIA Inc., Assured Guarantee Ltd. and Syncora Guarantee Inc. back about $2.5 billion of Prepa’s debt.

        "text_full": "Puerto Rico Utility Chief Confident on Deal With Bond Insurers\nPuerto Rico’s main electricity provider is confident it will reach a deal with insurance companies that guarantee repayment on a portion of its $8.3 billion of debt, the utility’s chief restructuring officer said.\nPuerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, is in discussions with insurance companies that guarantee debt on how to reduce its obligations and rehabilitate a system that relies heavily on crude oil to produce electricity. A forbearance agreement with some bondholders and fuel lenders expires Thursday night, unless the parties extend that deadline. The contract keeps restructuring talks out of court. Bondholders and fuel lenders last month agreed to a tentative plan that would include a 15 percent loss.\n“I am confident we will come to an agreement with the monolines,” Lisa Donahue, Prepa’s chief restructuring officer, said Tuesday at a meeting organized by Puerto Rico’s Chamber of Commerce in San Juan. “The solution with the monolines is much more complicated. Their model is cash out, while the bondholders are more inclined to cut losses.”\nPrepa, bondholders, insurance companies and fuel lenders have been in negotiations since August 2014. The utility has improved its operations during that time. Donahue expects to reduce recurring expenses by as much as $390 million through fuel improvements and changes to customer management. Prepa has already achieved $106 million of recurring savings and another $80 million in one-time savings, Donahue said.\nBond insurers MBIA Inc., Assured Guarantee Ltd. and Syncora Guarantee Inc. back about $2.5 billion of Prepa’s debt. The insurers would be required to make up to investors whatever principal or interest the utility fails to pay on time and in full. Prepa faces a $196 million interest payment on Jan. 1, Bloomberg data show.",

At the same time, Boehner wants to put some contentious issues to rest, like the debt limit, before leaving the top post in the House so that the next Speaker is not immediately caught up in bitter intra-party battles.\nDetails were not available yet on how much of a debt limit increase could be presented in the House.\nA spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would not comment on his intentions for moving a debt limit bill if the House were to act.\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan ; Editing by Sandra Maler and Lisa Lambert)",

It will come from bringing down personal taxes, offering relief on child care and unwinding cuts imposed during a three-year international bailout. \nIreland will still comfortably cut its budget deficit below the European Union target of 3 percent of GDP this year and Finance Minister Michael Noonan said talk of him introducing an \"excessively expansionary budget\" were well off the mark. \n\"These are sensible, affordable steps that will keep the recovery going and bring its benefits to every family,\" Noonan said in his fifth and final budget speech before elections due early next year. \n\"But we must not gamble with the future. This Government will not take chances that destabilise the recovery.\" \nLast week Noonan channelled 2015 tax windfalls into a late-year spending splurge. The country's central bank urged against using the fiscal gains to finance long-lasting spending commitments. \nBy next February or March, when an election is set to be called after speculation of a snap vote was dampened, the government will be hoping voters will start to feel the benefits of Noonan's 2016 tax cuts, public sector wage rises and a hike in the minimum wage. \nBut with the economy forecast to be Europe's best performing for a third successive year in 2016 and expand by at least 3 percent every year until 2020, Noonan said he would continue to with more of the same if re-elected. \nNoonan sought to tackle a severe shortage of housing in urban centres for the third budget in a row, mandating Ireland's bad bank, the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), to build 20,000 units by 2020 at the cost of 4.5 billion euros. \n(Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)",

It will come from bringing down personal taxes, offering relief on child care and unwinding cuts imposed during a three-year international bailout. \nIreland will still comfortably cut its budget deficit below the European Union target of 3 percent of GDP this year and Finance Minister Michael Noonan said talk of him introducing an \"excessively expansionary budget\" were well off the mark. \n\"These are sensible, affordable steps that will keep the recovery going and bring its benefits to every family,\" Noonan said in his fifth and final budget speech before elections due early next year. \n\"But we must not gamble with the future. This Government will not take chances that destabilise the recovery.\" \nLast week Noonan channelled 2015 tax windfalls into a late-year spending splurge. The country's central bank urged against using the fiscal gains to finance long-lasting spending commitments. \nBy next February or March, when an election is set to be called after speculation of a snap vote was dampened, the government will be hoping voters will start to feel the benefits of Noonan's 2016 tax cuts, public sector wage rises and a hike in the minimum wage. \nBut with the economy forecast to be Europe's best performing for a third successive year in 2016 and expand by at least 3 percent every year until 2020, Noonan said he would continue to with more of the same if re-elected. \nNoonan sought to tackle a severe shortage of housing in urban centres for the third budget in a row, mandating Ireland's bad bank, the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), to build 20,000 units by 2020 at the cost of 4.5 billion euros. \n(Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)",

PepsiCo says to market mobile phones, accessories in China Reuters – 8 minutes ago 98.03 +0.54 \nREUTERS - PepsiCo Inc said on Monday it is working with a licensing partner to market a line of mobile phones and accessories in China in the next few months. \nThe food and beverage company however has no plans to get into the mobile phone manufacturing business, a PepsiCo spokeswoman said by email. \n\"Available in China only, this effort is similar to recent globally licensed Pepsi products which include apparel and accessories,\" the spokeswoman said. \nThe spokeswoman did not name the licensing partner or give any further details about the phone. \nTechnology website Mobipicker was the first to report, on Oct. 11, that PepsiCo would present a smartphone, called Pepsi P1, with \"decent but not high-end specs\" on Oct. 20. ( http://bit.ly/1VObil2 ) \nPepsiCo already has many licensees across a number of categories. Last year, it tied up with companies such as Danish luxury stereo and TV maker Bang & Olufsen and Italian shoemaker Del Toro for a range of products for its football campaign. \nPepsiCo's shares were down 0.5 percent at $99 in late afternoon trading on Monday, while the broader market was flat. \n(Reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Don Sebastian and Savio D'Souza)",

The Speedy Trial Act was waived because Judge T.S. Ellis III found the case \"unusual and complex,\" the statement said.\nSimmons had appeared on Fox News, the top-ranked U.S. cable television news network, as an unpaid guest analyst on terrorism since 2002.\nA grand jury indicted him last week for portraying himself as an \"Outside Paramilitary Special Operations Officer\" for the CIA from 1973 to 2000.\nThe indictment said Simmons allegedly tried to use that claim to get government security clearances and work as a defense contractor. At one point he was deployed overseas as an intelligence adviser to senior military officers.\nHe faces charges of major fraud against the United States, wire fraud and making false statements to the government. A federal judge has ordered Simmons held in jail, citing arrests for driving under the influence and assault and firearms convictions.\nThe prosecutors' statement said Simmons' lawyer, public defender Whitney Minter, was seeking a top secret clearance.

        "text": "The European Central Bank said lending conditions largely continued to improve in the third quarter, spurred by its asset-purchase program and tighter competition among banks.\nCredit standards on loans to companies eased for the sixth consecutive quarter, the ECB’s Bank Lending Survey showed on Tuesday. Terms for mortgages tightened, with banks citing national regulation as the primary cause.

( bit.ly/1P6ePep )\nSome Wal-Mart department directors were told to cancel travel this week or make sure they come to the office on Friday, the report said, citing another person who spoke with the Wal-Mart employees.\nWal-Mart and its units had about 2.2 million employees globally, with nearly 1.4 million associates in the United States, as of the end of its fiscal 2015.\nWal-Mart did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.\nWal-Mart reported weaker quarterly earnings and lowered its annual forecast in August, as it coped with higher labor costs, a squeeze on pharmacy margins and sliding sales at its British supermarket chain.\nEarlier this month, the retailer said that it plans to hire 60,000 seasonal employees to work at its stores in the United States, the same as last year.

( bit.ly/1P6ePep )\nSome Wal-Mart department directors were told to cancel travel this week or make sure they come to the office on Friday, the report said, citing another person who spoke with the Wal-Mart employees.\nWal-Mart and its units had about 2.2 million employees globally, with nearly 1.4 million associates in the United States, as of the end of its fiscal 2015.\nWal-Mart did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.\nWal-Mart reported weaker quarterly earnings and lowered its annual forecast in August, as it coped with higher labor costs, a squeeze on pharmacy margins and sliding sales at its British supermarket chain.\nEarlier this month, the retailer said that it plans to hire 60,000 seasonal employees to work at its stores in the United States, the same as last year.

That missed the 864 million-euro estimate in an analyst survey compiled by Bloomberg. Net interest income fell to 1.27 billion euros from 1.40 billion euros a year earlier.\nSwedish banks have been pummeled by negative central bank rates, while markets buffeted by China’s slowdown and a commodities rout have made it more difficult to earn commissions and fees on trading. Negative rates alone are costing Sweden’s four biggest banks more than 1.4 billion kronor ($169 million) each quarter.\nBanks are struggling to earn money on lending as rates go negative\n“The summer months featured a seasonally lower activity level, although in the autumn we have not seen the usual pick-up in corporate and market activity,” Chief Executive Officer Christian Clausen said in the report. “Deposit margins continue to be under pressure and lending growth remains low.” He said the bank’s net interest income was nevertheless “holding up well.”\nSwedbank , the country’s biggest mortgage lender, on Tuesday reported a 14 percent decline in net income last quarter after weaker markets weighed on revenue from commissions. The bank’s total revenue declined after both net interest income and fee income fell.\nNordea said in August it will replace Clausen as CEO with Casper von Koskull, its head of wholesale banking, who takes over from Nov. 1.",

(AP) -- A jury awarded the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation more than $234 million Friday in a patent infringement lawsuit against computer maker Apple Inc. \nThe jury set the amount after about three hours of deliberations. It was about $165 million less than the foundation had sought, but its legal team was all smiles and handshakes after the verdict was read, the Wisconsin State Journal reported (http://bit.ly/1MuCa4t ). The same jury found Tuesday that Apple infringed on the patent, triggering the damages phase of the trial. \nThe patent dispute involved chip technology co-invented by University of Wisconsin-Madison computer sciences professor Gurindar Sohi, who was in the courtroom for the decision. The technology improves the speed and efficiency of processors that run popular Apple mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads, extending battery life by as much as two hours. \n\"For Dr. Sohi, I hope you felt that your invention was vindicated,\" U.S. District Judge William Conley said. \nApple spokeswoman Rachel Tulley said only that the company plans to appeal. Apple's attorneys declined to comment. \nThe nonprofit Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation serves as the technology transfer arm of UW-Madison by patenting and commercializing campus inventions. \n\"This is a case where the hard work of our university researchers and the integrity of patenting and licensing discoveries has prevailed,\" said Carl Gulbrandsen, managing director of the foundation. \"The jury recognized the seminal computer processing work that took place on our campus.\" \nFoundation attorney Morgan Chu asked the jury for a royalty of $2.74 per unit, while Apple attorney William Lee said the patent infringement was worth a royalty of only 7 cents per unit. The number of units involved was closely guarded information, shown only to the lawyers and the jury, not to the public. \n___",

Learn more... \nMon, Oct 12, 2015, 18:59 BST - UK Markets closed Government to sell final Royal Mail shareholding overnight By John Ficenec | Telegraph – 17 minutes ago +1.73 \nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills authorises sale of remaining 14pc shareholding. \nThe Government has announced plans to sell its remaining 14pc stake in Royal Mail to take advantage of \"current market conditions\", placing the postal service fully into private hands for the first time in its 500-year history. \nThe sale of about 140m shares will take place overnight through a process known as an \"accelerated book build\" to institutional investors only, with retail investors unable to buy stock. \nThe deal should raise more than £660m at current market prices and marks a final exit for the Government. \n• George Osborne announces Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) sell off and deep spending cuts \nThe 499-year-old postal service was privatised in October 2013 , but the 38pc rise in its share price on its first day on the stock market led to accusations that the Government had sold it off too cheaply. \nRoyal Mail was floated at 330p a share, and stood at 526p in early January, it has since fallen to close at 471.2p on Monday. \nThe price at which the final tranche of Royal Mail shares are sold will be announced tomorrow. \nA Department for Business spokesman said: \"The Business Secretary has today authorised a sale process to begin. Current market conditions should allow a successful sale and the realisation of value for the taxpayer. \n\"The universal postal service is strongly protected by law and Ofcom has a duty to ensure its provision. Therefore the government sees no policy reason to retain a stake in Royal Mail.\" \nThe Chancellor has been exiting the Government's stake in Royal Mail this year as he is looking to raise a total of £1.5bn, as part of a £4.5bn debt reduction plan. \nA sale of a 15pc holding, at 500p in June, raised £750m, and last month a 1pc shareholding worth was transferred to the Royal Mail Share Incentive Plan.",

Learn more... \nMon, Oct 12, 2015, 18:59 BST - UK Markets closed Government to sell final Royal Mail shareholding overnight By John Ficenec | Telegraph – 17 minutes ago +1.73 \nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills authorises sale of remaining 14pc shareholding. \nThe Government has announced plans to sell its remaining 14pc stake in Royal Mail to take advantage of \"current market conditions\", placing the postal service fully into private hands for the first time in its 500-year history. \nThe sale of about 140m shares will take place overnight through a process known as an \"accelerated book build\" to institutional investors only, with retail investors unable to buy stock. \nThe deal should raise more than £660m at current market prices and marks a final exit for the Government. \n• George Osborne announces Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) sell off and deep spending cuts \nThe 499-year-old postal service was privatised in October 2013 , but the 38pc rise in its share price on its first day on the stock market led to accusations that the Government had sold it off too cheaply. \nRoyal Mail was floated at 330p a share, and stood at 526p in early January, it has since fallen to close at 471.2p on Monday. \nThe price at which the final tranche of Royal Mail shares are sold will be announced tomorrow. \nA Department for Business spokesman said: \"The Business Secretary has today authorised a sale process to begin. Current market conditions should allow a successful sale and the realisation of value for the taxpayer. \n\"The universal postal service is strongly protected by law and Ofcom has a duty to ensure its provision. Therefore the government sees no policy reason to retain a stake in Royal Mail.\" \nThe Chancellor has been exiting the Government's stake in Royal Mail this year as he is looking to raise a total of £1.5bn, as part of a £4.5bn debt reduction plan. \nA sale of a 15pc holding, at 500p in June, raised £750m, and last month a 1pc shareholding worth was transferred to the Royal Mail Share Incentive Plan.",

Brazil's oil company association, the IBP, also blames growing government control of the industry.\nChambriard, speaking to reporters in Rio de Janeiro, said she expects Brazil to import 400,000 barrels a day of vehicle fuels, primarily gasoline, in 10 years. Projected imports of gasoline and diesel are more than double the 176,879 barrels that Brazil imported daily during the first nine months of 2015, according to ANP data.\nDespite declining fuel demand, spurred by Brazil's economy facing its worst recession since the 1990s, Petrobras' 14 Brazilian refineries cannot meet all the country's needs.\nChambriard also said the ANP is studying a plan to renew some oil-rights concessions granted to Petroleo Brasileiro SA , as Petrobras is formally known, early. The concessions, granted in the so-called \"Round Zero\" to Petrobras involved some of the company's most important fields.\nThe areas represented concessions Petrobras was allowed to keep after Brazil's government ended the company's monopoly on Brazilian exploration and production in 1997.

That’s the lowest level of trading in at least a decade, a sign that individuals are hesitant to buy more municipal debt with benchmark interest rates close to a five-month low.\n“Yields are extremely low and so people who own bonds have reinvestment risk,” said Matt Fabian, a partner at Concord, Massachusetts-based MMA. “You could trade it away, but what do you trade into? Spreads are so tight that you don’t get much of a pickup in trading by extending maturity or buying lower-grade credits.”\nThe $3.7 trillion municipal market has rallied since the Federal Reserve last month kept borrowing costs close to zero. That pushed the yield on AAA 10-year munis down to 2.07 percent from as much as 2.4 percent in July, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nIt’s not easy to find securities with yields that are much higher. Investors get an extra 1.04 percentage points of yield to buy 30-year debt instead of bonds due in a decade, a less attractive proposition than the 1.24-percentage-point average pickup over the past five years, Bloomberg data show. BBB rated 10-year bonds have interest rates 1.13 percentage point higher than top-rated munis, below the average spread of 1.33 percentage point since the start of 2013.\nIt doesn’t help trading volume that the way individuals buy and sell munis is shifting, Fabian said. Fewer investors have brokers who are paid a commission for each trade, instead of a money-management fee, which is curbing the financial incentive for brokers to buy and sell bonds at a time of depressed yields, he said.\n“There needs to be more opportunity in trading -- we need at least more volatile spreads,” Fabian said. “Higher yields would definitely help.”",

        "text": "Eni SpA is exploring the sale of its chemical division Versalis, three months after the unit returned to profit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nThe Italian oil company is working with Barclays Plc on a potential sale of Versalis, which may fetch as much as 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), the people said, asking not to be identified as the process is private. Several private-equity firms may be interested in bidding for the unit, they said.

Total payments will be capped at $50 for households with proof-of-purchase, and $12 for those without. \nSome 60,000 claims have been filed, and more are expected, said plaintiffs' attorney Tucker Ronzetti at a court hearing. \nAnheuser-Busch also agreed to add labels identifying the Beck's brand as having been made in the United States for the next five years, and to make similar changes to its website. \nThe beer maker also agreed to pay $3.5 million in lawyers’ fees under the agreement approved by U.S. Magistrate Judge John J. O'Sullivan in the U.S. Southern District of Florida. \nThe suit was filed by a Florida man in Oct. 2013, “alleging that Beck’s Pilsner had been falsely or misleadingly labelled,” according to court documents. \nIn its settlement, Anheuser-Busch did not admit wrong-doing. \n\"Beck's has always been truthful, transparent and in compliance with all legal requirements,\" Jorn Socquet, vice president of marketing at Anheuser-Busch said in an email. \n(Editing by Letitia Stein, Bernard Orr)",
