The book and periodical-publishing division will be combined into a business with about $3.5 billion in sales. Edgar Online, Bowne Financial and the financial-printing operations will form a third, with about $1 billion in sales.\n“We recognize that parts of the current portfolio will be more successful pursuing different strategies, and that these particular businesses offer the scale, expertise, product and service mix and other resources to excel as standalone companies,” Chief Executive Officer Thomas Quinlan said in the statement.\nRR Donnelley bought Edgar in 2012 and Bowne in 2010. Its most recent purchase was the $293.9 million takeover of book publisher Courier Corp. in June. The group’s split will enable each business to follow its own capital structure and investment policy and enable a more focused planning for each brand, the company said.\nRR Donnelley plans to spin off to its shareholders the financial-communications and publishing companies in a tax-free transaction by the end of 2016, according to the statement.",

Paxton was fined last year for not disclosing to Texas securities regulators he was getting commissions for soliciting investors. \nPaxton aides didn't respond to messages seeking comment from The Associated Press.",

Paxton was fined last year for not disclosing to Texas securities regulators he was getting commissions for soliciting investors. \nPaxton aides didn't respond to messages seeking comment from The Associated Press.",

A 23 percent drop in Micron Technology Inc, another one of Greenlight's top long positions, also hurt as did a 4 percent drop in Apple Inc's stock price, Greenlight's biggest bet.\nOn Friday, gold was at $1,094.91 an ounce, down 16 percent since the middle of January and off from a record peak of $1,900 hit four years ago.\nUnlike mutual funds, hedge funds are not required to disclose their monthly returns and many managers do not disclose them, so any performance numbers, especially from big name managers, are scrutinized closely for industry trends.\nThe broader stock market Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 1.28 percent in July.\nMeanwhile Daniel Loeb's $17.5 billion Third Point fared much better this month, posting a 1 percent gain its main fund, extending the year-to-date gains to 6.8 percent, an investor in the fund said.\nTraditionally Einhorn and Loeb are among the first managers to inform clients of their returns every month.

        "text": "(Adds detail from decision)\nBy Andrew Chung\nNEW YORK Aug 4 (Reuters) - An Akorn Inc unit's proposed generic glaucoma drug infringed three Allergan Inc patents on its Lumigan topical treatment for the eye disease, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Tuesday.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit also said five of Allergan's Lumigan patents were valid. The decision upheld rulings by a federal court in the Eastern District of Texas.\nThe case stems from lawsuits Allergan filed in 2011 against Akorn's Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co Inc, Novartis AG, and Lupin Ltd over proposed generic versions of Lumigan, which has more than $600 million in annual sales.\nLumigan is used to lower eye pressure in glaucoma patients. The Allergan patents cover an improved version of Lumigan that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010, the appeals court decision said.\nThe lower Texas court had rejected the generic drugmakers' arguments that Allergan's patents were obvious compared to previously patented inventions and did not deserve legal protection. It also said the proposed generic versions would infringe the patents.\nThe Federal Circuit upheld the invalidity rulings on Tuesday, as well as the ruling that Hi-Tech's proposed drug infringed the patents.\nThe case is Allergan, Inc. v. Sandoz Inc, No. 14-1275, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. (Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Jonathan Oatis)",

The decision upheld rulings by a federal court in the Eastern District of Texas.\nThe case stems from lawsuits Allergan filed in 2011 against Akorn's Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co Inc, Novartis AG, and Lupin Ltd over proposed generic versions of Lumigan, which has more than $600 million in annual sales.\nLumigan is used to lower eye pressure in glaucoma patients. The Allergan patents cover an improved version of Lumigan that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010, the appeals court decision said.\nThe lower Texas court had rejected the generic drugmakers' arguments that Allergan's patents were obvious compared to previously patented inventions and did not deserve legal protection. It also said the proposed generic versions would infringe the patents.\nThe Federal Circuit upheld the invalidity rulings on Tuesday, as well as the ruling that Hi-Tech's proposed drug infringed the patents.\nThe case is Allergan, Inc. v. Sandoz Inc, No. 14-1275, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. (Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Jonathan Oatis)",

How to shop for a student account \nGiven that most students will spend much of their degree courses 'in the red', the first thing to look for in a student bank account is a generous interest-free overdraft. \nThe best accounts offer fee-free, interest-free overdrafts of up to £3,000. However, this upper limit usually only applies to year three (or year four if your degree's a year longer), so it starts off lower and then rises with each academic year. \nAlso, you must understand that you may not get the maximum overdraft advertised, as your individual limit will be based on your credit score. However, some banks do guarantee to give you this upper limit, so always check whether the overdraft limit on offer with the student bank account is 'guaranteed' or only 'up to'. \nDon't be tempted to exceed your overdraft limit without permission. Remember, it's a limit , not a target – and you must pay back all this borrowed money one day. If you do go overdrawn without permission, then you could be charged sky-high rates of interest, plus painful penalties of up to £30 per transaction on top. \nAfter 0% overdrafts, the next features to consider are credit interest rates (how much you'll be paid when your balance is above zero) and freebies, gifts and other incentives. \nConvenience does also play a part, with many students signing up to banks which have branches or cashpoints on campus.

Running second is Mauricio Macri, the business-friendly mayor of the capital city who wants to do well enough in the October vote to force a November run-off.\nBoth are former businessmen with more orthodox policies than Fernandez, whose high public spending has drained fiscal accounts and fueled inflation while currency and trade controls slowed investment.\nMacri promises to quickly free the markets. Scioli says \"gradualism\" is the best way to open the economy while preserving the strong social safety net weaved together by Fernandez since she first took power in 2007.\nThe primary is set up for each party to choose its presidential candidate, but with voters free to cross party lines, Sunday's vote will be a dry run ahead of the October election.\nArgentine stock and bond prices will likely fall if Scioli comes out of Sunday's primary strong enough to win the presidency in October's first round. If Macri looks strong enough to force a run-off in November, markets are set to rise.\nTo win outright in October, a candidate needs 45 percent of votes cast or 40 percent with a 10-point spread over the second place candidate.\nScioli needs close to 40 percent of the primary vote to have a chance of a first-round win. Ignacio Labaqui, who analyses Argentina for Medley Global Advisors, said Macri's coalition needs at least 30 percent on Sunday to stay in serious contention.\nMacri vows to scrap currency controls and grains export curbs, and to negotiate an end to the U.S. court battle with holders of non-paying sovereign bonds that has hobbled Argentina's finances by keeping it in default.\nScioli has revealed few details of his program, as he treads gingerly to lock in Fernandez's left-leaning base without alienating the wider electorate.\nFernandez's policies have fueled one of the world's highest inflation rates, but poor voters who have benefited from state largesse over the last eight years remain loyal to her.

That was just below expectations for a 0.3 percent expansion in a Reuters poll.\nFactory output edged up 0.1 percent from May. Mexico sends nearly 80 percent of its exports, mostly factory goods, to the United States.\nThe construction sector, which also is a component of industrial production, rose 0.4 percent month-on-month.\nMexico's economy grew at its slowest pace in more than a year in the first quarter, undermined by flagging oil production and weak U.S. demand for exports.\nData on Tuesday, however, showed mining expanded by 1.1 percent in June from May, with oil and gas extraction rising 1.2 percent in its second monthly increase in a row.\nDeclining Mexican crude production had been weighing on growth, and a slump in global oil prices has curbed expectations for a tide of funds into the country's energy sector, which was recently opened to private investment.\nCompared with June 2014, industrial output rose 1.4 percent , above expectations for a 1.0 percent expansion. In seasonally adjusted terms, the annual rate of expansion was 0.6 percent, the statistics agency said. (Reporting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",

That was just below expectations for a 0.3 percent expansion in a Reuters poll.\nFactory output edged up 0.1 percent from May. Mexico sends nearly 80 percent of its exports, mostly factory goods, to the United States.\nThe construction sector, which also is a component of industrial production, rose 0.4 percent month-on-month.\nMexico's economy grew at its slowest pace in more than a year in the first quarter, undermined by flagging oil production and weak U.S. demand for exports.\nData on Tuesday, however, showed mining expanded by 1.1 percent in June from May, with oil and gas extraction rising 1.2 percent in its second monthly increase in a row.\nDeclining Mexican crude production had been weighing on growth, and a slump in global oil prices has curbed expectations for a tide of funds into the country's energy sector, which was recently opened to private investment.\nCompared with June 2014, industrial output rose 1.4 percent , above expectations for a 1.0 percent expansion. In seasonally adjusted terms, the annual rate of expansion was 0.6 percent, the statistics agency said. (Reporting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",

It was the first Marvel movie in three years not to open in first place, according to Rentrak Corp. Fox has slipped to fourth place this year at the domestic box office, after leading all studios in 2014. \n“This movie is now pacing for a writeoff and a loss of over $60 million, creating a negative start to Fox’s already cautious forecast,” Barton Crockett, an analyst at FBR & Co., said in a research note Sunday. \nChief Financial Officer John Nallen told investors on an Aug. 5 conference call that he expected profit at the film studio to decline by $200 million this year from the $1.45 billion reported for the fiscal year ended June 30.

A spokesman, Chris Petrikin, declined to comment on potential losses. Fox has scheduled a sequel for June 2017, according to Box Office Mojo. Fox is committed to the property, according to Petrikin. \nOnly 9 percent of critics gave “Fantastic Four” a positive review, according to RottenTomatoes.com.

REUTERS/Mike … WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose for a third straight month in July, but inflation pressures remain benign against the backdrop of lower oil prices and a strong \ndollar. \nThe Labor Department said on Friday its producer price index for final demand increased 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in June. \nAn increase of 0.4 percent in services prices, which offset a fall of 0.1 percent in the cost of goods, accounted for the increase in the PPI last month. \nIn the 12 months through July, the PPI fell 0.8 percent after declining 0.7 percent in June. It was the sixth straight 12-month decrease in the index. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and falling 0.9 percent from a year ago. \nA strong dollar and weaker oil prices are keeping a lid on inflation, which has some economists believing that the Federal Reserve will be hesitant to raise interest rates next month. \nInflation has been persistently running below the Fed's 2 percent target. Last month, wholesale gasoline prices rose 1.5 percent after gaining 4.3 percent in June. \nFood prices dipped 0.1 percent in July as egg prices tumbled after surging in recent months. Food prices increased 0.6 percent in June. Wholesale chicken egg prices fell 24.2 percent in July after soaring a record 84.5 percent in June. \nThe volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, rose 0.4 percent in July after increasing 0.2 percent in the prior month. \nA key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.3 percent in June. The so-called core PPI was up 0.9 percent in the 12 months through July. \n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",

REUTERS/Mike … WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose for a third straight month in July, but inflation pressures remain benign against the backdrop of lower oil prices and a strong \ndollar. \nThe Labor Department said on Friday its producer price index for final demand increased 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in June. \nAn increase of 0.4 percent in services prices, which offset a fall of 0.1 percent in the cost of goods, accounted for the increase in the PPI last month. \nIn the 12 months through July, the PPI fell 0.8 percent after declining 0.7 percent in June. It was the sixth straight 12-month decrease in the index. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and falling 0.9 percent from a year ago. \nA strong dollar and weaker oil prices are keeping a lid on inflation, which has some economists believing that the Federal Reserve will be hesitant to raise interest rates next month. \nInflation has been persistently running below the Fed's 2 percent target. Last month, wholesale gasoline prices rose 1.5 percent after gaining 4.3 percent in June. \nFood prices dipped 0.1 percent in July as egg prices tumbled after surging in recent months. Food prices increased 0.6 percent in June. Wholesale chicken egg prices fell 24.2 percent in July after soaring a record 84.5 percent in June. \nThe volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, rose 0.4 percent in July after increasing 0.2 percent in the prior month. \nA key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.3 percent in June. The so-called core PPI was up 0.9 percent in the 12 months through July. \n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",

His spokesman confirmed the comment.\nSeveral European ministers have visited Tehran since a nuclear deal was struck last month, hoping to benefit from the opening of a major economy with a young, well-educated population of just under 80 million and some of the world's largest energy reserves.\nThe nuclear deal will lead to international sanctions, which had frozen much European business investment in Iran, being lifted in the coming months.\nItaly, which was not directly part of the nuclear talks, began pushing for better relations with Iran even before the deal was struck, and Gentiloni last visited Tehran in March.\nItalian oil and gas group Eni, which had a major presence until 2001, has said it will consider investing in Iran again if sanctions are lifted and it receives favourable contract terms.\nInvestment bank Mediobanca on Tuesday said that it, along with Italy's development ministry and export credit agency SACE, had signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran's economy ministry and its central bank.\nLast week, France's foreign minister, who had pursued a hard line during the nuclear talks, invited Rouhani to visit Paris in November, for what would be the first Iranian state visit to France since 1999.

These aircraft will be delivered between 2016 and 2021 and will enable Iberia to replace and expand its existing longhaul fleet,\" IAG said in a statement. \nReinforcement of the Iberia fleet follows a difficult period for the carrier in recent years, which required heavy restructuring to improve its financial performance. \nIAG also said it had converted options it took in 2013 into firm orders for 20 Airbus 320neo planes to facilitate fleet replacement for the group airlines that also include low-cost Spanish company Vueling, and Aer Lingus (Other OTC: AELGF - news ) of Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) which it is in the process of acquiring. \n\"The aircraft will be delivered between 2020 and 2021 and can be used by any airline in the Group for fleet replacement. These modern, fuel efficient aircraft will bring both cost efficiencies and environmental benefits to the airlines' fleet,\" it said.",

Learn more... \nThu, Aug 6, 2015, 18:46 BST - UK Markets closed IAG orders 31 Airbus planes as seeks to modernise Iberia fleet AFP – 20 minutes ago View Photo \n\nBritish Airways and Iberia holding company International Airlines Group (IAG) said Thursday it had ordered 31 Airbus plans, including firm orders for 11 longhaul craft for its Spanish airline. \nThe order by Anglo-Spanish IAG, which includes eight A350-900 and three A330-300 widebody craft for Iberia -- covers a total of 31 Airbus planes with a book value of $4.6 billion (4.2 billion euros). \n\"International Airlines Group (IAG) is converting eight A350-900 and three Airbus A330-200 long-haul aircraft options into firm orders for Iberia. These aircraft will be delivered between 2016 and 2021 and will enable Iberia to replace and expand its existing longhaul fleet,\" IAG said in a statement. \nReinforcement of the Iberia fleet follows a difficult period for the carrier in recent years, which required heavy restructuring to improve its financial performance. \nIAG also said it had converted options it took in 2013 into firm orders for 20 Airbus 320neo planes to facilitate fleet replacement for the group airlines that also include low-cost Spanish company Vueling, and Aer Lingus (Other OTC: AELGF - news ) of Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) which it is in the process of acquiring. \n\"The aircraft will be delivered between 2020 and 2021 and can be used by any airline in the Group for fleet replacement. These modern, fuel efficient aircraft will bring both cost efficiencies and environmental benefits to the airlines' fleet,\" it said.",

        "text": "CALGARY, Alberta Aug 10 Athabasca Oil Corp has suspended the production of 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent a day (boe/d) of light oil, becoming the latest western Canadian producer to curb output due to the Alliance Pipeline natural gas mainline shutdown.\nAlliance declared force majeure on its 2,400-mile (3,850- km) pipeline, which delivers gas and natural gas liquids from western Canada and North Dakota's Williston Basin to the Chicago market, last week after poisonous hydrogen sulphide entered the system.\nThe pipeline company, a limited partnership owned by affiliates of Enbridge Income Fund Holdings and Veresen Inc, called on shippers to suspend injections into the pipeline on Friday so the affected gas could be flared off.\nThe Alliance mainline accounts for about a third of Canada's daily net exports to the United States and the shutdown is expected to last several more days.\nAthabasca said on Monday it managed to shift a portion of its production from the Kaybob region in west central Alberta to other pipeline systems, but approximately 84 percent of its light oil output was impacted nonetheless.\nIt joins a number of other oil and gas producers, including Seven Generations Energy and NuVista Energy Ltd , that have been forced to trim some or all production.\nAthabasca said five days of downtime on the Alliance pipeline would cut its third quarter light oil production guidance of 5,000 boe/d by approximately 250 boe/d.\nThe hydrogen sulphide gas entered the pipeline system as a result of complications experienced by an upstream operator that Alliance did not name.\nHowever, midstream company Keyera Corp said it had a brief operational upset last Wednesday at its Simonette, Alberta, gas plant, which resulted in gas that did not meet sales gas specifications entering the Alliance Pipeline.\nKeyera said it had offered assistance to Alliance and was working with producer customers to divert their gas.

A poll of analysts by Reuters had forecast a rate of 2.75 percent.\nThe annual rate was the lowest on record, according to central bank data going back to 1970, holding below the central bank's 3 percent target for a third month.\nInflation is expected to remain below 3 percent for the rest of the year, but the central bank is still forecast to raise interest rates when U.S. borrowing costs move higher, even though Mexican economic growth is sluggish.\nPolicymakers are concerned a further tumble in the peso could hit inflation expectations. The peso has lost more than 20 percent against the dollar since the middle of last year and it hit a record low of near 16.50 per dollar in July.\nLast week, Mexico boosted its dollar auctions to defend the currency and central bank governor Agustin Carstens warned the bank could raise interest rates at any time, even before the Fed, if the peso needs the support.\nEconomists think the central bank is unlikely to move before the U.S. Federal Reserve unless the peso weakens much further.\n\"If this continues, we have a problem, but we don't have a problem with the peso at 16.50, particularly when inflation is running below the target,\" said Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs in New York.\nThe Mexican data showed that consumer prices rose by 0.15 in July, just below expectations. The core price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.17 percent, in line with the poll.\nThe 12-month core inflation rate came in at 2.31 percent, also in line with forecasts.\n(Reporting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by Bernadette Baum , Bernard Orr )",

She didn’t mention a $58 million payment due the same day by the Public Finance Corp.\nA default would mark an escalation in the debt crisis that’s been racking the island, where officials are pushing for what may be the biggest restructuring ever in the municipal market. Puerto Rico bond prices have slipped amid speculation that the island won’t pay be able to repay what it owes as its economy stagnates and residents leave for the U.S. mainland.\nIsland officials have said that Puerto Rico may skip the payment on the Finance Corp. bonds, which have some of the weakest protections for investors.\nThe debt is only paid for with money appropriated by the legislature, instead of a general claim on the commonwealth’s tax money. Faced with a budget shortfall, lawmakers didn’t provide the money when they passed the annual spending plan in June.\nIsland officials said that Puerto Rico’s available cash was limited to funding essential services such as health and safety.\nGovernor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in June that the commonwealth cannot pay all of its obligations, following years of borrowing to paper over budget shortfalls.

She didn’t mention a $58 million payment due the same day by the Public Finance Corp.\nA default would mark an escalation in the debt crisis that’s been racking the island, where officials are pushing for what may be the biggest restructuring ever in the municipal market. Puerto Rico bond prices have slipped amid speculation that the island won’t pay be able to repay what it owes as its economy stagnates and residents leave for the U.S. mainland.\nIsland officials have said that Puerto Rico may skip the payment on the Finance Corp. bonds, which have some of the weakest protections for investors.\nThe debt is only paid for with money appropriated by the legislature, instead of a general claim on the commonwealth’s tax money. Faced with a budget shortfall, lawmakers didn’t provide the money when they passed the annual spending plan in June.\nIsland officials said that Puerto Rico’s available cash was limited to funding essential services such as health and safety.\nGovernor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in June that the commonwealth cannot pay all of its obligations, following years of borrowing to paper over budget shortfalls. Officials plan to draft a debt-restructuring plan by Sept. 1.",

        "text": "+0.05 \n\"Bond King\" Bill Gross warns global recovery could \"go badly\" if deflationary mindset takes hold \nVeteran bond investor Bill Gross has warned that the global economy is \"dangerously close\" to becoming a \"deflationary world\". \nBill Gross, a money manager at Janus Capital (NYSE: JNS - news ) and co-founder of Pimco, told Bloomberg that once there was a “whiff of deflation, things tend to reverse and go badly.\" \n\"[There is a sense of] a deflationary world around the globe in terms of commodity prices and currencies - the dramatic decline in emerging market currencies are a deflationary force for the US, it’s certainly not a positive for equities and risk markets,\" he said. \nMr Gross highlighted that key commodity indices were not just at cyclical lows, but lower than in 2008 when Lehman Brothers collapsed. \nHe said recent falls in commodity prices were a better indicator of what is happening in the economy because they reflected real-time supply and demand. \nMr Gross said the US Federal Reserve appeared \"mentally committed\" to raise interest rates this year - most likely in September. \nHowever, he said an initial tightening of more than 25 basis points could \"scare the market\". When asked if falling commodity prices and the stronger dollar should influence the Fed's decision, he said: \n\"I hope so. They always stress that currency is not a consideration. But I hope it becomes a consideration because when markets move so dramatically, and they have in emerging markets, and they have in developed markets almost 15pc to 20pc over the last six months ... that’s a dramatic move. \n\"That’s almost a bubble in reverse and it has significant implications for inflation in the US, call it deflation if you will. But we're moving closer to that point.\"",

When asked if falling commodity prices and the stronger dollar should influence the Fed's decision, he said: \n\"I hope so. They always stress that currency is not a consideration. But I hope it becomes a consideration because when markets move so dramatically, and they have in emerging markets, and they have in developed markets almost 15pc to 20pc over the last six months ... that’s a dramatic move. \n\"That’s almost a bubble in reverse and it has significant implications for inflation in the US, call it deflation if you will. But we're moving closer to that point.\"",

Traders said Monday would see some catch-up gains in Europe following a late recovery on Wall Street and a slight push higher in Asia, where China's stock markets got a lift on investor expectations of yet another round of policy stimulus. \n\"The gut reaction to the (U.S.) non-farm payrolls was to sell, but...we saw U.S. markets pare back a significant portion of their initial losses and we're seeing that filter into today's open,\" Jonathan Sudaria, a trader at London Capital Group, told clients. \nThere was also an injection of optimism over Greece, which according to an official hopes to conclude negotiations with international creditors by early Tuesday at the latest. \n\"Growing optimism amongst EU officials would appear to suggest that Greece had made significant concessions with respect to new austerity measures,\" CMC (Shanghai: 600327.SS - news ) Markets analyst Michael Hewson said. \nSANOFI (NasdaqGM: GCVRZ - news ) \nThe French pharmaceutical company is teaming up with Germany's Evotec (Other OTC: EVOTF - news ) and Austrian biotech firm Apeiron Biologics to develop a new type of immune system-boosting cancer medicine that could be given as tablets to fight both solid tumours and blood cancers. \nBHP BILLITON (NYSE: BBL - news ) \nBHP Billiton said on Sunday it would cut 380 jobs at its Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine in Australia, citing global market conditions in the resources sector and a desire to ensure the project was sustainable.",

Traders said Monday would see some catch-up gains in Europe following a late recovery on Wall Street and a slight push higher in Asia, where China's stock markets got a lift on investor expectations of yet another round of policy stimulus. \n\"The gut reaction to the (U.S.) non-farm payrolls was to sell, but...we saw U.S. markets pare back a significant portion of their initial losses and we're seeing that filter into today's open,\" Jonathan Sudaria, a trader at London Capital Group, told clients. \nThere was also an injection of optimism over Greece, which according to an official hopes to conclude negotiations with international creditors by early Tuesday at the latest. \n\"Growing optimism amongst EU officials would appear to suggest that Greece had made significant concessions with respect to new austerity measures,\" CMC (Shanghai: 600327.SS - news ) Markets analyst Michael Hewson said. \nSANOFI (NasdaqGM: GCVRZ - news ) \nThe French pharmaceutical company is teaming up with Germany's Evotec (Other OTC: EVOTF - news ) and Austrian biotech firm Apeiron Biologics to develop a new type of immune system-boosting cancer medicine that could be given as tablets to fight both solid tumours and blood cancers. \nBHP BILLITON (NYSE: BBL - news ) \nBHP Billiton said on Sunday it would cut 380 jobs at its Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine in Australia, citing global market conditions in the resources sector and a desire to ensure the project was sustainable.",

We have not made decision about the divestment and it should become clear within the next four to six weeks,\" Thiraphong said.\nThe Bumble Bee acquisition was announced last December as TUF stepped up its international expansion drive, but the U.S. Department of Justice subsequently launched an antitrust investigation of TUF's U.S. subsidiary Tri-Union Seafoods LLC, which operates Chicken of the Sea, the third-largest U.S. tuna brand.\nTri-Union has received a subpoena from the U.S. authorities requiring it to provide relevant information for the investigation of the packaged seafood industry in the United States, the company said.\nThe U.S. market is the company's biggest, contributing 42 percent of sales in the first half. TUF also aimed to focus in growing markets in Africa, Canada and Asia, Thiraphong said.\nTUF is on track to achieve a target of $8 billion in sales in 2020 through acquisitions and organic, or self-generated, growth, and the company's low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.68 times would provide opportunity to invest more, Thiraphong said.

Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. \nTracking service FlightAware reported that at one point, more than 400 flights had been delayed or canceled across those airports. \nSome flights at BWI were pushed back more than three hours, while a number of travelers at Dulles were told to expect delays of more than an hour. \n\"An FAA automation system that experienced problems earlier today is back in service,\" the Federal Aviation Administration said, announcing that operations were returning to normal. \n\"FAA is continuing root cause analysis to determine what caused the problem & is working closely w/airlines to minimize impacts to travelers.\" \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) identified the glitch at an air traffic control center in Leesburg, Virginia, just south of the US capital Washington. \nThe FAA had earlier directed high altitude traffic around the affected airspace. \nThe affected airports are among the country's busiest. \nThe delays had nothing to do with accidents or hacking, an aviation official said.",
