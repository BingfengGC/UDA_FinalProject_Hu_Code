Other field partners are Suncor Energy Inc and Britain's BG Group, which is being bought by Royal Dutch Shell.\nLast year, production averaged about 154,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to UK government data. So far this year, average output has come up to about 168,000 bpd thanks in part to fewer outages, the sources said.\n\"Production has been pretty stable all year,\" said an industry source. \"The field is doing well.\"\nBuzzard pumps less than 0.2 percent of daily world oil supply but it is the largest field contributing to Forties blend, the most important of the four North Sea crude grades underpinning the Brent benchmark.\nThis location, at the centre of the benchmark used to price two thirds of he world's oil, gives the field a bigger impact on pricing than its size would otherwise justify.\nIn 2014, Reuters reported on at least six unplanned shutdowns or production glitches at Buzzard. So far this year, only one outage has been reported and a planned shutdown is scheduled for October.\nMore reliable output is helping lead to more stable exports of Forties crude blend, in contrast to 2014 when cargoes often faced delays in their loading dates.\nNexen in early 2014 said it was targeting improved reliability at Buzzard and detailed steps it had taken in order to achieve this, such as improving the information available to workers in the field's control room.\nThe company declined to comment on Buzzard's performance on Tuesday.

He was fired a year ago after Lloyds was fined about 226 million pounds ($345 million) by U.S. and U.K. regulators. The lender is contesting the claim.\nThe case is one of a spate of unfair-dismissal lawsuits to reach London courts in recent weeks following investigations at the world’s biggest banks into the rigging of foreign-exchange markets and benchmarks related to Libor. Some of the individuals were fired because of alleged behavior unrelated to manipulation that their employers say they discovered as a result of internal inquiries.\n“We consider this claim to be entirely without merit and it will continue to be vigorously defended,” Lloyds spokesman Ian Kitts said by e-mail. “The individual concerned was dismissed following a thorough disciplinary process following the group’s investigation into Libor related issues and the settlements reached” with the Financial Conduct Authority and other authorities.\nReed didn’t immediately return messages to his LinkedIn page. The employment tribunal declined to give details of his lawyers.",

        "text_full": "Lloyds Trader Fired Over Libor Rigging Sues for Unfair Dismissal\nA former Lloyds Banking Group Plc trader sued the bank for unfair dismissal after he was fired in the wake of the company’s fines for Libor manipulation.\nAndrew Reed, who inputted the bank’s submissions to the yen London interbank offered rate, will have his case heard at a London employment tribunal on Sept. 16, according to the court schedule. He was fired a year ago after Lloyds was fined about 226 million pounds ($345 million) by U.S. and U.K. regulators. The lender is contesting the claim.\nThe case is one of a spate of unfair-dismissal lawsuits to reach London courts in recent weeks following investigations at the world’s biggest banks into the rigging of foreign-exchange markets and benchmarks related to Libor. Some of the individuals were fired because of alleged behavior unrelated to manipulation that their employers say they discovered as a result of internal inquiries.\n“We consider this claim to be entirely without merit and it will continue to be vigorously defended,” Lloyds spokesman Ian Kitts said by e-mail. “The individual concerned was dismissed following a thorough disciplinary process following the group’s investigation into Libor related issues and the settlements reached” with the Financial Conduct Authority and other authorities.\nReed didn’t immediately return messages to his LinkedIn page. The employment tribunal declined to give details of his lawyers.",

        "text": "CHICAGO, Sept 17 City homeowners who have enjoyed free garbage service for generations would face a $9.50-a-month assessment under a plan Mayor Rahm Emanuel intends to present next week, a source familiar with proposal said on Thursday.\nThe city's first-ever garbage fee would be tucked in the water bills of as many as 613,000 homeowners possibly as early as Jan. 1 and raise nearly $70 million toward a $745 million budget shortfall.\nChicago's precarious finances have resulted in junk-bond status for the city, putting it alongside Detroit as the only major American held in such low regard by bond-rating agencies. Much of Chicago's financial distress stems from escalating pension payments, which consume roughly one out of every three city dollars.\nThe garbage assessment, if approved by Chicago's City Council, would leave New York City and Boston as the only major American cities that do not impose any fees on their residents for garbage pickup.\nThe rate Emanuel has settled on also is below garbage-collection fees assessed on residents of Los Angeles, Atlanta, Seattle and several of Chicago's suburbs, according to a briefing document on the proposal circulated to Chicago aldermen and seen on Thursday by Reuters.\n\"I don't see any city, at least among the ones they listed, anywhere close to what the city is charging,\" said Alderman Joe Moore, an Emanuel ally who represents a lakefront ward on Chicago's north side. \"From that point of view, it'll be cheap.\"\nThe mayor's plan will carry teeth for those who are late or do not pay the trash assessment. Their water will be shut off by city crews, who will continue to remove trash because of public health concerns.\nEmanuel's garbage proposal is expected to accompany a $500 million property-tax increase the mayor will unveil in his 2016 city budget proposal on Tuesday. That tax hike represents a 62-percent increase over the existing city property-tax levy.\nThe garbage fee will apply to those who live in single-family homes, two-, three- and four-unit residences. Under current city law, those living in multifamily apartment or condominium dwellings with more than four units must contract for private waste-hauling.\n(Reporting by Dave McKinney; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )",

Much of Chicago's financial distress stems from escalating pension payments, which consume roughly one out of every three city dollars.\nThe garbage assessment, if approved by Chicago's City Council, would leave New York City and Boston as the only major American cities that do not impose any fees on their residents for garbage pickup.\nThe rate Emanuel has settled on also is below garbage-collection fees assessed on residents of Los Angeles, Atlanta, Seattle and several of Chicago's suburbs, according to a briefing document on the proposal circulated to Chicago aldermen and seen on Thursday by Reuters.\n\"I don't see any city, at least among the ones they listed, anywhere close to what the city is charging,\" said Alderman Joe Moore, an Emanuel ally who represents a lakefront ward on Chicago's north side. \"From that point of view, it'll be cheap.\"\nThe mayor's plan will carry teeth for those who are late or do not pay the trash assessment. Their water will be shut off by city crews, who will continue to remove trash because of public health concerns.\nEmanuel's garbage proposal is expected to accompany a $500 million property-tax increase the mayor will unveil in his 2016 city budget proposal on Tuesday. That tax hike represents a 62-percent increase over the existing city property-tax levy.\nThe garbage fee will apply to those who live in single-family homes, two-, three- and four-unit residences. Under current city law, those living in multifamily apartment or condominium dwellings with more than four units must contract for private waste-hauling.\n(Reporting by Dave McKinney; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )",

Warnings have intensified as the Federal Reserve prepares to increase interest rates for the first time in almost a decade, the beginning of the end to an unprecedented era of stimulus that pushed $1.1 trillion of investor cash into the bond market, according to data from the\nInvestment Company Institute.\nDebelle said China’s efforts to support its currency by running down foreign reserves probably comprises some sales of U.S. treasuries and other sovereign bonds due to their liquidity and are in turn affecting global long-term yields.\n“We are seeing an unusual situation where a risk-off environment is associated with sales of the risk-free assets by a large market participant, rather than purchases,” Debelle said.\nTurning to Australia, Debelle highlighted the recent slowdown in population growth, meaning there are “some grounds to believe” the economy’s medium-term growth rate has slowed.\n“But the orders of magnitude we are talking about are pretty small, of the order of a quarter of a percent,” he said. “That is well within the range of error around our knowledge of the longer term growth rate of the economy. That said, I realize a quarter of a percentage point can matter a lot actuarially when compounded over a number of years.”\nWhile the government bond yield is the best measure of the risk-free yield in the economy, Debelle said “there are some reasons to believe that is now structurally lower than it used to be.”\nHowever, he said that any proposition that economic growth, and therefore risk-free yields, will be lower than in the past due to slower rates of innovation and technical progress was “too pessimistic.”",

Therefore, it is premature to comment on whether any specific immediate surveillance measures are also necessary in Europe and whether vehicles sold by Volkswagen in Europe are also affected.\n\"But let me be clear: We need to get to the bottom of this. For the sake of our consumers and the environment, we need certainty that industry scrupulously respects emissions limits.\" (Reporting by Barbara Lewis and Alastair Macdonald ; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek)",

In the rollover, T-bill holders - mostly Greek banks - renew their positions instead of getting paid on the maturing paper they hold.\nThe sale's bid-to-cover ratio was 1.30, unchanged from the last sale. The amount raised included 300 million euros in non-competitive bids.\nSettlement will be on Sept. 18, the same day that 1.6 billion euros of six-month bills mature.

The FTSEurofirst 300 rose and was last up 2.0 percent on the day. \nGerman bund futures hit the day's high and were last up 70 ticks on the day at 153.84. Yields on benchmark 10-year German bonds, which the ECB has been buying under its quantitative easing programme, were down 4 basis points at 0.75 percent, with other euro zone equivalents down 2-8 bps.

The FTSEurofirst 300 rose and was last up 2.0 percent on the day. \nGerman bund futures hit the day's high and were last up 70 ticks on the day at 153.84. Yields on benchmark 10-year German bonds, which the ECB has been buying under its quantitative easing programme, were down 4 basis points at 0.75 percent, with other euro zone equivalents down 2-8 bps.

        "text": "RICHMOND, Va., Sept 4 A top Federal Reserve official said on Friday he had seen enough healing in the U.S. labor market to warrant raising interest rates soon.\nRichmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who had advocated for a rate hike in June and will have a vote at the Fed's Sept. 16-17 policy meeting, said the U.S. economy no longer needs interest rates near zero.\n\"It's time to align our monetary policy with the significant progress we have made,\" Lacker said in prepared remarks titled \"The Case Against Further Delay.\"\nLacker's comments came just minutes before the Labor Department was due to release its monthly employment report for August, which was expected to show robust job growth.\nSeveral Fed policymakers have said the report would be critical for the central bank's decision over whether to raise rates this month.\nBut Lacker said the healing in the job market needed for a hike have already materialized, even if the jobs report disappointed.\n\"It's quite unlikely that a one-month blip would materially alter the labor market picture or, for that matter, the monetary policy outlook,\" he said.\nLacker said the strongest evidence supporting higher rates was that consumer spending had picked up substantially. This was probably the result of stronger earnings by families and expectations the economy would continue to improve.\nThe labor market was probably already at full strength, he said, and there were already signs that wages could rise at a faster clip.\n\"Over the last year or so, reports of difficulty finding and hiring qualified workers have become notably more widespread and persistent,\" he said, referring to reports in his region.\nLacker said no discussion of the economy's state would be complete without considering recent volatility in financial markets.\nWorries over the strength of China's economy appear to have prompted the volatility, he said, but he noted that developments in China were unlikely to have a direct impact on U.S. economy.

        "text_full": "Fed's Lacker argues Fed should raise rates soon\nRICHMOND, Va., Sept 4 A top Federal Reserve official said on Friday he had seen enough healing in the U.S. labor market to warrant raising interest rates soon.\nRichmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who had advocated for a rate hike in June and will have a vote at the Fed's Sept. 16-17 policy meeting, said the U.S. economy no longer needs interest rates near zero.\n\"It's time to align our monetary policy with the significant progress we have made,\" Lacker said in prepared remarks titled \"The Case Against Further Delay.\"\nLacker's comments came just minutes before the Labor Department was due to release its monthly employment report for August, which was expected to show robust job growth.\nSeveral Fed policymakers have said the report would be critical for the central bank's decision over whether to raise rates this month.\nBut Lacker said the healing in the job market needed for a hike have already materialized, even if the jobs report disappointed.\n\"It's quite unlikely that a one-month blip would materially alter the labor market picture or, for that matter, the monetary policy outlook,\" he said.\nLacker said the strongest evidence supporting higher rates was that consumer spending had picked up substantially. This was probably the result of stronger earnings by families and expectations the economy would continue to improve.\nThe labor market was probably already at full strength, he said, and there were already signs that wages could rise at a faster clip.\n\"Over the last year or so, reports of difficulty finding and hiring qualified workers have become notably more widespread and persistent,\" he said, referring to reports in his region.\nLacker said no discussion of the economy's state would be complete without considering recent volatility in financial markets.\nWorries over the strength of China's economy appear to have prompted the volatility, he said, but he noted that developments in China were unlikely to have a direct impact on U.S. economy.

        "text": "* Canadian dollar at C$1.3400, or 74.63 U.S. cents * Bond prices mostly higher across maturity curve TORONTO, Sept 29 The Canadian dollar was a touch softer against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, as the higher price of oil, which rose on evidence that U.S. crude supplies were tightening, helped the currency recoup some of the overnight losses that pushed it to fresh 11-year lows. Overall investor sentiment remained somewhat grim, with global stocks sliding to their lowest in more than two years as commodity prices and emerging markets like China, a major commodities consumer, remained under pressure. * At 10:04 a.m. EDT (1404 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.3400 to the greenback, or 74.63 U.S. cents, marginally weaker than the Bank of Canada's official close of C$1.3394, or 74.66 U.S. cents. * The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3385, while its weakest level was C$1.3434, the softest it's been since June, 2004. * In Canada, producer prices for August fell slightly more than expected following three straight months of gains due to the lower cost of energy and petroleum products. * In the United States, home prices rose in July to match the June pace, but fell shy of expectations, according to the S&P/Case Shiller composite index. * Canada's gross domestic product for July is expected at 8:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday. * U.S. crude prices were up 1.37 percent to $45.04, while Brent crude added 1.50 percent to $48.05. * Canadian government bond prices were mostly higher across the maturity curve, with the two-year price flat to yield 0.506 percent and the benchmark 10-year rising 8 Canadian cents to yield 1.436 percent. * The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was -15.1 basis points, while the 10-year spread was -64.3 basis points.

Overall investor sentiment remained somewhat grim, with global stocks sliding to their lowest in more than two years as commodity prices and emerging markets like China, a major commodities consumer, remained under pressure. * At 10:04 a.m. EDT (1404 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.3400 to the greenback, or 74.63 U.S. cents, marginally weaker than the Bank of Canada's official close of C$1.3394, or 74.66 U.S. cents. * The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3385, while its weakest level was C$1.3434, the softest it's been since June, 2004. * In Canada, producer prices for August fell slightly more than expected following three straight months of gains due to the lower cost of energy and petroleum products. * In the United States, home prices rose in July to match the June pace, but fell shy of expectations, according to the S&P/Case Shiller composite index. * Canada's gross domestic product for July is expected at 8:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday. * U.S. crude prices were up 1.37 percent to $45.04, while Brent crude added 1.50 percent to $48.05. * Canadian government bond prices were mostly higher across the maturity curve, with the two-year price flat to yield 0.506 percent and the benchmark 10-year rising 8 Canadian cents to yield 1.436 percent. * The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was -15.1 basis points, while the 10-year spread was -64.3 basis points.

        "text": "(Adds TransCanada comment, details of layoffs)\nBy Nia Williams\nCALGARY, Alberta, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Pipeline company TransCanada Corp will cut 20 percent of its senior management positions as a continuing slump in oil prices has necessitated cost reductions, with further staff cuts possible in the future, a company spokesman said on Thursday.\nThe company behind the Keystone XL and Energy East pipeline projects said staff were informed Monday about the cuts, which would be implemented over the next several months.\n\"We don't have an exact number for reductions at the senior level as the process is continuing but when transitions out of the company and retirements are complete, we expect about a 20 per cent reduction in senior leadership positions,\" spokesman James Millar said in a statement.\n\"Falling oil prices and the current environment are having a profound impact on our customers and we must do all we can to drive down costs and pursue our projects more efficiently and strategically.\"\nMillar said it would be up to the leaders of business units and other support areas to determine how many employees are affected.\nTransCanada laid off 185 people from its major projects division in June, joining several other Calgary-based energy companies, including Suncor Energy Inc and Penn West Petroleum, that had trimmed staffing levels in order to survive the oil price slump.\nU.S. benchmark crude prices have tumbled nearly 60 percent since June 2014, and were last trading at just under $45 a barrel.

        "text": "Sept 25 European health regulators on Friday conditionally approved Amgen Inc's rare blood cancer drug, Blincyto, which is one of the world's most expensive cancer treatments.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December approved Blincyto for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which has few treatment options once a patient has relapsed.\nBlincyto is a so-called bispecific antibody, an emerging class of drugs that could prove more potent than conventional antibodies - the mainstay treatment for many forms of cancers.\nAn estimated 6,250 Americans, mostly children, will be diagnosed with ALL this year and 1,450 of them will succumb to the disease, according to the American Cancer Society.\nThe European Medicines Agency conditionally approves a drug when it is meant for a severely debilitating disease with few or no treatment options, and when the benefits of its immediate availability outweigh the risks.\nThe conditional approval is granted despite the lack of complete trial data and is renewed annually until the EMA is satisfied with the complete data to fully approve the drug.\nAmgen, the world's largest biotechnology company, expects final European approval for Blincyto in the coming months.\nThe drug, which it got through the acquisition of biotechnology company Micromet in 2012, costs about $178,000 for two courses of treatment.\nPharmaceutical companies have recently come under fire over high prices for specialty drugs and U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan on Wednesday to address \"price gouging\".

JGC, Tenaga and Acwa Power declined to comment. Engie was not immediately available for comment. \nPreviously set to end on Sept. 15, bidding is now due to close on Nov. 1, said one of the sources. \nThe project will be based on a build, own, operate and transfer basis and the power agreement will be for 20 years, SEC said on its website. SEC will hold 50 percent of the project, Saudi Aramco 10 percent with the bid winner taking 40 percent. \nThe plant will use 475 million standard cubic feet per day (scfd) of Low BTU Gas per day from the Khursaniyah oilfield. \nCommercial operation of the project is expected in February 2020, SEC said on its website.

Learn more... \nThu, Sep 3, 2015, 00:34 BST - UK Markets open in 7 hrs 26 mins Rousseff says Brazil will try to get out of first budget deficit AFP – 10 minutes ago View Photo \n\nAfter presenting Brazil's first ever budget deficit, President Dilma Rousseff promised Wednesday that her government will work hard to get back in the black. \n\"We are being straightforward. And we are showing, clearly, that there is a problem,\" she said at a news briefing. \nRousseff's government delivered the proposed budget to Congress Monday predicting a primary deficit amounting to 0.5 percent of GDP, or 30.5 billion reais ($8.4 billion). \nThis was the first time a Brazilian government has unveiled a plan that would mean government spending outstrips revenue. \nThe news follows last week's prediction that Brazil has just entered its worst recession since 1931 and a host of other downbeat economic news, coupled with political turmoil. \nA primary budget reflects the government's ability to manage savings and debt. The worry for Brazil now is that its debt load will lead to a loss of its investment-grade credit rating, which would be a serious blow to the economy. \n\"We want to meet the goal that we set,\" Rousseff told reporters. \"So we are going to get that deficit down.\" \nAmid the tough economic climate, inflation also is high at 9.56 percent and unemployment has risen to 7.5 percent. \nRousseff's popularity, with the economy so weak and major corruption scandals swirling, has skidded to single digits. \nBrazil saw boom years peaking with 7.5 percent economic growth in 2010. But Latin America's biggest country -- the host of next year's Summer Olympics -- has been brought down by plunging commodity prices and political instability.",

Learn more... \nThu, Sep 3, 2015, 00:34 BST - UK Markets open in 7 hrs 26 mins Rousseff says Brazil will try to get out of first budget deficit AFP – 10 minutes ago View Photo \n\nAfter presenting Brazil's first ever budget deficit, President Dilma Rousseff promised Wednesday that her government will work hard to get back in the black. \n\"We are being straightforward. And we are showing, clearly, that there is a problem,\" she said at a news briefing. \nRousseff's government delivered the proposed budget to Congress Monday predicting a primary deficit amounting to 0.5 percent of GDP, or 30.5 billion reais ($8.4 billion). \nThis was the first time a Brazilian government has unveiled a plan that would mean government spending outstrips revenue. \nThe news follows last week's prediction that Brazil has just entered its worst recession since 1931 and a host of other downbeat economic news, coupled with political turmoil. \nA primary budget reflects the government's ability to manage savings and debt. The worry for Brazil now is that its debt load will lead to a loss of its investment-grade credit rating, which would be a serious blow to the economy. \n\"We want to meet the goal that we set,\" Rousseff told reporters. \"So we are going to get that deficit down.\" \nAmid the tough economic climate, inflation also is high at 9.56 percent and unemployment has risen to 7.5 percent. \nRousseff's popularity, with the economy so weak and major corruption scandals swirling, has skidded to single digits. \nBrazil saw boom years peaking with 7.5 percent economic growth in 2010. But Latin America's biggest country -- the host of next year's Summer Olympics -- has been brought down by plunging commodity prices and political instability.",

According to Sky News , Metro (Dusseldorf: 62M.DU - news ) - Britain's first new high street lender for more than a century - has asked investment bankers to pitch for roles advising on an initial public offering which could take place as soon as the first quarter of next year. \nThe move comes despite the threat of a future hit from Chancellor George Osborne's new corporation tax surcharge, which is expected to rake in more than £25m in annual profits. \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) cited sources as saying that Metro (Other OTC: MTRAF - news ) aimed to appoint advisers for its planned flotation in the coming weeks. \nInvestment banks which have worked on earlier private fundraisings, such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Royal Bank of Canada (Other OTC: RBCDF - news ) , are said to be in the frame for key roles on the deal. \nSo far, Metro Bank has raised over £600m from investors, meaning the revised total after a successful flotation could reach close to the mooted £1bn valuation of the business. \nMetro Bank has over 35 branches, most of which are in London and the south-east, and has continued to report strong customer and deposit growth despite ongoing losses (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

Learn more... \nTue, Sep 8, 2015, 20:29 BST - UK Markets closed Metro Bank reportedly begins talks on £1bn flotation By Michele Maatouk | Sharecast – 3 hours ago 19.5559 0.0000 \nLONDON (ShareCast) - (ShareCast News) - Metro Bank has reportedly begun talks with advisers as it steps up its preparations for a London listing with a potential value of more than £1bn. According to Sky News , Metro (Dusseldorf: 62M.DU - news ) - Britain's first new high street lender for more than a century - has asked investment bankers to pitch for roles advising on an initial public offering which could take place as soon as the first quarter of next year. \nThe move comes despite the threat of a future hit from Chancellor George Osborne's new corporation tax surcharge, which is expected to rake in more than £25m in annual profits. \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) cited sources as saying that Metro (Other OTC: MTRAF - news ) aimed to appoint advisers for its planned flotation in the coming weeks. \nInvestment banks which have worked on earlier private fundraisings, such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Royal Bank of Canada (Other OTC: RBCDF - news ) , are said to be in the frame for key roles on the deal. \nSo far, Metro Bank has raised over £600m from investors, meaning the revised total after a successful flotation could reach close to the mooted £1bn valuation of the business. \nMetro Bank has over 35 branches, most of which are in London and the south-east, and has continued to report strong customer and deposit growth despite ongoing losses (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

Treasury auctions, said a person familiar with the matter. \nThe Department of Financial Services sent letters to the banks in early August, seeking information on their operations related to Treasury auctions, the person said. \nThe letters do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing by the banks, said the person. \nThe Financial Times, citing sources, reported that the letters contained general questions and that the probe was in early stages with no focus on any particular bank. ( http://on.ft.com/1JSDKww ) \nU.S. Department of Justice spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment. Representatives of Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs also declined to comment. \nBarclays did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nAll the banks are primary dealers in the $12.5 trillion Treasury market, authorized to transact directly with the Federal Reserve.

Ukraine had refused to keep paying the price of $247 per thousand cubic metres that it had paid in the second quarter.\nThe two countries have been haggling since then over the price that would be embodied in a new agreement to secure winter gas supplies.\n\"In the region of $230 dollars plus or minus,\" Novak said when asked about the price of gas for the fourth quarter, according to comments cited by RIA news agency.\nNovak added that the exact price would depend on a formula that takes the caloric value of the gas into account.\nHe was speaking after the conclusion of gas talks between Russia, Ukraine and the European Commission which led to a tentative agreement that has not yet been signed.\nA price of $230 per thousand cubic metres would be slightly more than the $220 that Ukraine has described as acceptable, but below the $235-$242 that Russia has said is the average for its long-term European customers in 2015.\nEuropean energy chief Maros Sefcovic said after the talks that the price would be \"at a competitive level comparable to the prices offered to the neighbouring EU countries.\"\nThe provisional agreement also involves supplying 2 billion cubic metres of gas in October. Ukraine's Naftogaz will pay Russia's Gazprom $500 million for those supplies, with the money supplied by European and international financial institutions.\nCommenting on the agreement on Saturday, Gazprom chief Alexei Miller said that there was no guarantee Ukraine would be able to pay for further supplies in November and December.\n\"Today we are establishing that Ukraine has received money - this $500 million, and will begin to take Russian gas from the start of October,\" Miller said, in remarks to Russia 24 television channel cited by RIA.\n\"But 2 billion cubic metres doesn't solve the problem...

        "text": "BOGOTA, Sept 21 Raising Colombia's benchmark interest rate would be bad for its slowing economy, central bank board member Cesar Vallejo said, adding that accelerating inflation is temporary and anchored to expectations.\nVallejo, one of seven members of the central bank board, told a local newspaper on Sunday that though there has been a pronounced deceleration in the economy, it has been orderly and Colombia is doing better than other countries in the region.\nThe Andean nation's economy grew 3 percent in the second quarter of 2015.\n\"The economy is decelerating and raising the rate would be like kicking us when we're down,\" Vallejo told El Tiempo newspaper.\n\"It's clear that there is a very strong deceleration, we should be seeing excesses of capacity which will take inflation down to the goal,\" he said.\nThe central bank has set a 2 percent to 4 percent goal for year-end inflation. Consumer prices reached 4.74 percent in the twelve months to August.\nPolicymakers on the bank's board have held borrowing costs at 4.5 percent for the last 12 months. However, analysts have said the board ought to raise the rate to counteract inflation.\nBut Vallejo said consumer price increases, spurred by a 51 percent depreciation in the peso currency and higher food prices due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, cannot be offset by rate rises.\n\"When people get nervous and believe that all prices are going to go up, that creates a contagion and they start to ask for better wages, people stock up before prices rise and it becomes an inflation spiral that has no relation to reality,\" Vallejo said.\n\"That can do a lot of damage to the economy. If that happens you don't act using rates,\" he added.\nA peso-to-dollar exchange rate of 2,600 or 2,800 pesos to the dollar would be reasonable, the policymaker added. The currency was 2,984.9 to the dollar on Monday. (Reporting by Nelson Bocanegra; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",

Consumer prices reached 4.74 percent in the twelve months to August.\nPolicymakers on the bank's board have held borrowing costs at 4.5 percent for the last 12 months. However, analysts have said the board ought to raise the rate to counteract inflation.\nBut Vallejo said consumer price increases, spurred by a 51 percent depreciation in the peso currency and higher food prices due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, cannot be offset by rate rises.\n\"When people get nervous and believe that all prices are going to go up, that creates a contagion and they start to ask for better wages, people stock up before prices rise and it becomes an inflation spiral that has no relation to reality,\" Vallejo said.\n\"That can do a lot of damage to the economy. If that happens you don't act using rates,\" he added.\nA peso-to-dollar exchange rate of 2,600 or 2,800 pesos to the dollar would be reasonable, the policymaker added. The currency was 2,984.9 to the dollar on Monday. (Reporting by Nelson Bocanegra; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",

RSA, which has caught the eye of Zurich Insurance (Xetra: ZFI1.DE - news ) , said the Swiss insurer has been made aware of the sales process in recent discussions and the transaction is not conditional on the outcome of their possible offer for RSA. \nChief executive Stephen Hester said: \"With RSA's focus on its largest markets in the UK & Ireland, Scandinavia and Canada, it has become increasingly clear to us that RSA is no longer the best strategic owner of these businesses. In Suramericana we have an experienced and committed regional player who can make the business a much more central part of their strategy.\" RSA added that the deal is expected to be strongly accretive to capital, enhancing its operational flexibility. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) added that the disposal is consistent with its stated target to substantially complete its strategic refocus by the 2015 year end results announcement. \nNomura said the disposal was \"incrementally positive\" for the Zurich/RSA deal to go through. \n\"LatAm was a low returning business, and although there will be slightly less synergies, we believe this overall creates more value for Zurich at possible offer price of 550p versus previously,\" it said. \nAt 0835 BST, RSA shares were up 1% at 508.50p.",

RSA, which has caught the eye of Zurich Insurance (Xetra: ZFI1.DE - news ) , said the Swiss insurer has been made aware of the sales process in recent discussions and the transaction is not conditional on the outcome of their possible offer for RSA. \nChief executive Stephen Hester said: \"With RSA's focus on its largest markets in the UK & Ireland, Scandinavia and Canada, it has become increasingly clear to us that RSA is no longer the best strategic owner of these businesses. In Suramericana we have an experienced and committed regional player who can make the business a much more central part of their strategy.\" RSA added that the deal is expected to be strongly accretive to capital, enhancing its operational flexibility. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) added that the disposal is consistent with its stated target to substantially complete its strategic refocus by the 2015 year end results announcement. \nNomura said the disposal was \"incrementally positive\" for the Zurich/RSA deal to go through. \n\"LatAm was a low returning business, and although there will be slightly less synergies, we believe this overall creates more value for Zurich at possible offer price of 550p versus previously,\" it said. \nAt 0835 BST, RSA shares were up 1% at 508.50p.",

On Tuesday, the blue chip swap rate was 13.66 pesos per dollar.\nThe CNV's ruling means those funds would have to report a steep loss in their holdings. Rather than face that, some decided on Tuesday to sell their bonds, traders said.\nThe price of Argentina's over-the-counter bonds fell an average of 0.5 percent, with the Bonar 24 leading the fall, down 2.1 percent.\nThe sell-off helped soak up pesos on the local market and dampened demand for the dollar which is trading close to the psychological barrier of 16 pesos on the black market, traders said.\n\"In order to not have to report strong losses in the future, these institutional investors are selling their positions today, which is relieving pressure on the dollar,\" a local trader said on condition of anonymity.\nThe peso was trading 0.25 percent weaker at 15.94 per dollar on Tuesday but did not breach the 16 barrier.\nRuling party candidate Daniel Scioli, who leads the presidential race, said on Monday that he would not let the market determine the exchange rate if he were elected president. Instead, he would uphold the current system whereby the central bank manages the rate.\nHis main rival, market-favorite Mauricio Macri, has said he would allow the peso to float freely.

Operations at the mine's solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX-EW) plants will not be affected during the transition period, the company said.\n\"Implementing this reduction in the operating rate at El Abra reduces operating costs and near-term capital requirements, and provides a longer mine life for its existing Sulfolix ore reserves with a better opportunity to sell its copper production into an anticipated improved copper market in the future,\" Freeport said in a statement.\nEarlier this week, a Chilean union that represents copper mine workers rejected the drastic job cuts and said it was considering action.

Costco stopped accepting Amex cards exclusively, and switched to Visa instead. Citigroup Inc will issue Costco Visa credit cards.\nAmex said in February the loss of Costco would hurt its earnings for the next two years, and threaten nearly 8 percent of the worldwide annual spending on its cards.\nSam's Club says it is the eighth largest U.S. retailer, with more than 650 locations in the United States and Puerto Rico. It accepts MasterCard Inc's MasterCard and Discover Financial Services Inc's Discover card in its physical stores. Online, Sam's Club already accepts American Express, in addition to Mastercard, Discover, and Visa Inc's Visa. Wal-Mart's main stores already accept American Express.\nThe warehouse retailer has 500,000 small business customers, an important group of clients for American Express, said Anre Williams, president of global merchant services at American Express.

Costco stopped accepting Amex cards exclusively, and switched to Visa instead. Citigroup Inc will issue Costco Visa credit cards.\nAmex said in February the loss of Costco would hurt its earnings for the next two years, and threaten nearly 8 percent of the worldwide annual spending on its cards.\nSam's Club says it is the eighth largest U.S. retailer, with more than 650 locations in the United States and Puerto Rico. It accepts MasterCard Inc's MasterCard and Discover Financial Services Inc's Discover card in its physical stores. Online, Sam's Club already accepts American Express, in addition to Mastercard, Discover, and Visa Inc's Visa. Wal-Mart's main stores already accept American Express.\nThe warehouse retailer has 500,000 small business customers, an important group of clients for American Express, said Anre Williams, president of global merchant services at American Express.

The metal had fallen to $1,098.35 in the previous session, its lowest since Aug. 11. \n* U.S. gold edged up 0.2 percent to $1,104.90. \n* The Fed will kick off a two-day policy meet on Wednesday, with a statement expected on Thursday. \n* Gold prices have been hurt this year by uncertainty over the timing of the Fed's first rate hike in nearly a decade. \n* Gold has benefited in recent years from ultra-low rates, which cut the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while weighing on the dollar, in which it is priced. \n* Concerns over slowing economic growth in China, mixed economic data and volatility in financial markets have increased uncertainty about the timing of any U.S. rate increase, which had been expected as early as this month. \n* Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer sentiment hit its lowest in a year in early September and producer prices were flat in August, signalling moderate economic growth and tame inflation that could weigh on the Fed's decision whether to hike interest rates. \n* Hedge funds and money managers cut their bullish stance in COMEX gold contracts to a three-week low in the week ended Sept. 8, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. \n* Gold coin sales in the United States and Europe have surged in the third quarter, with sales from the U.S. Mint reaching levels not seen since the price crash of 2013, as low prices and a series of market shocks fuel retail buying. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The dollar, euro and yen all got off to a slow start on Monday with investors sticking to the sidelines as the countdown begins on whether the Fed will hike interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. \nDATA AHEAD (GMT) \n0430 Japan Industrial production Jul \n0900 Euro zone Industrial production Jul \n(Reporting by A.

The metal had fallen to $1,098.35 in the previous session, its lowest since Aug. 11. \n* U.S. gold edged up 0.2 percent to $1,104.90. \n* The Fed will kick off a two-day policy meet on Wednesday, with a statement expected on Thursday. \n* Gold prices have been hurt this year by uncertainty over the timing of the Fed's first rate hike in nearly a decade. \n* Gold has benefited in recent years from ultra-low rates, which cut the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while weighing on the dollar, in which it is priced. \n* Concerns over slowing economic growth in China, mixed economic data and volatility in financial markets have increased uncertainty about the timing of any U.S. rate increase, which had been expected as early as this month. \n* Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer sentiment hit its lowest in a year in early September and producer prices were flat in August, signalling moderate economic growth and tame inflation that could weigh on the Fed's decision whether to hike interest rates. \n* Hedge funds and money managers cut their bullish stance in COMEX gold contracts to a three-week low in the week ended Sept. 8, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. \n* Gold coin sales in the United States and Europe have surged in the third quarter, with sales from the U.S. Mint reaching levels not seen since the price crash of 2013, as low prices and a series of market shocks fuel retail buying. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The dollar, euro and yen all got off to a slow start on Monday with investors sticking to the sidelines as the countdown begins on whether the Fed will hike interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. \nDATA AHEAD (GMT) \n0430 Japan Industrial production Jul \n0900 Euro zone Industrial production Jul \n(Reporting by A.

Boeing declined to say how many of the planes had been previously ordered, and how that would affect the actual value of the deal.\nEarlier on Wednesday, China's ICBC Financial Leasing Co, a unit of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 601398.SS, separately confirmed it will buy 30 of Boeing's 737-800 jets, worth $2.88 billion at list prices.\nBoeing also was due to announce later in the day an agreement to build a 737 completion center in China that would finish and deliver 737s built at Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington.\nMachinist union members say they stand to lose work to China and were due to protest on Wednesday. Boeing said on Tuesday it doesn't expect to lay off or reduce staff related to the 737 because of the new factory in China.\nBoeing is battling with rival Airbus Group for dominance of Chinese market, which Boeing says will need $1 trillion worth of new planes over the next two decades.\nAirbus supplied 6 percent of mainland China's aircraft in 1995, but in 2008 the European plane maker put an assembly plant in China to make its A320 aircraft, which competes with Boeing's 737.

As it is, the strain of meeting guidelines and making a profit was evidently already enough to prompt Volkswagen to cheat.\n“Inevitably, VW’s issue creates the conditions for a reshuffle of assets that may lead to mergers among carmakers once the dust of the scandal is settled,” said Emanuele Vizzini, who helps manage 3.6 billion euros ($4 billion) as chief investment officer at Investitori Sgr in Milan, including FCA shares. “We expect Fiat to be an active player helped by the positive momentum of its business.”",

As it is, the strain of meeting guidelines and making a profit was evidently already enough to prompt Volkswagen to cheat.\n“Inevitably, VW’s issue creates the conditions for a reshuffle of assets that may lead to mergers among carmakers once the dust of the scandal is settled,” said Emanuele Vizzini, who helps manage 3.6 billion euros ($4 billion) as chief investment officer at Investitori Sgr in Milan, including FCA shares. “We expect Fiat to be an active player helped by the positive momentum of its business.”",

Assuming the latest estimate from the New York-based strategist is accurate, the index would post a loss of 2.9 percent for the year.\nA return to optimism among investors may also help the index exceed 2,000, according to Kostin.

The new guidelines are a very important step towards ensuring that all people living with HIV have immediate access to anti-retroviral treatment,\" said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS. \n\"According to UNAIDS estimates, expanding ART to all people living with HIV and expanding prevention choices can help avert 21 million AIDS-related deaths and 28 million new infections by 2030.\" \nUnder current WHO guidelines, 28 million people are deemed eligible for anti-retroviral treatment. \nMajor suppliers of HIV drugs include Gilead, ViiV Healthcare, which is majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline (Amsterdam: GO8.AS - news ) (GSK) , and multiple Indian generic manufacturers. \nAll people at \"substantial\" risk of contracting HIV should also be given preventive anti-retroviral treatment, not just men who have sex with men, the WHO said. \nThe medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) welcomed the move to expand treatment but warned that \"turning this new recommendation into reality would require dramatically increased support from donors and governments\".

The new guidelines are a very important step towards ensuring that all people living with HIV have immediate access to anti-retroviral treatment,\" said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS. \n\"According to UNAIDS estimates, expanding ART to all people living with HIV and expanding prevention choices can help avert 21 million AIDS-related deaths and 28 million new infections by 2030.\" \nUnder current WHO guidelines, 28 million people are deemed eligible for anti-retroviral treatment. \nMajor suppliers of HIV drugs include Gilead, ViiV Healthcare, which is majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline (Amsterdam: GO8.AS - news ) (GSK) , and multiple Indian generic manufacturers. \nAll people at \"substantial\" risk of contracting HIV should also be given preventive anti-retroviral treatment, not just men who have sex with men, the WHO said. \nThe medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) welcomed the move to expand treatment but warned that \"turning this new recommendation into reality would require dramatically increased support from donors and governments\".

Ukraine had refused to keep paying the price of $247 per thousand cubic metres that it had paid in the second quarter. \nThe two countries have been haggling since then over the price that would be embodied in a new agreement to secure winter gas supplies. \n\"In the region of $230 dollars plus or minus,\" Novak said when asked about the price of gas for the fourth quarter, according to comments cited by RIA news agency. \nNovak added that the exact price would depend on a formula that takes the caloric value of the gas into account. \nHe was speaking after the conclusion of gas talks between Russia, Ukraine and the European Commission which led to a tentative agreement that has not yet been signed. \nA price of $230 per thousand cubic metres would be slightly more than the $220 that Ukraine has described as acceptable, but below the $235-$242 that Russia has said is the average for its long-term European customers in 2015. \nEuropean energy chief Maros Sefcovic said after the talks that the price would be \"at a competitive level comparable to the prices offered to the neighbouring EU countries.\" \nThe provisional agreement also involves supplying 2 billion cubic metres of gas in October. Ukraine's Naftogaz will pay Russia's Gazprom $500 million for those supplies, with the money supplied by European and international financial institutions. \nCommenting on the agreement on Saturday, Gazprom chief Alexei Miller said that there was no guarantee Ukraine would be able to pay for further supplies in November and December. \n\"Today we are establishing that Ukraine has received money - this $500 million, and will begin to take Russian gas from the start of October,\" Miller said, in remarks to Russia 24 television channel cited by RIA. \n\"But 2 billion cubic metres doesn't solve the problem...

The city has had to hike its tax rate to offset losses from shuttered casinos and property tax appeals.\nThe $262 million spending plan for fiscal 2015, which began in January, includes all federal and state funds and is $2.76 million smaller than last year.\nThe city's emergency manager Kevin Lavin, appointed by Christie in February, said in a report earlier this year that the city had a $101 million deficit.\nThe city has been closing that gap through frozen salaries, a halt in promotions, attrition, three kinds of financial aid from the state and a federal grant to retain 85 firefighters through 2017.\nThe city is also deferring $38 million of employee health and pension payments to the state.\nBut it is also still counting on some money that might not materialize: casino taxes and payments that have been going in part to marketing efforts.\nUnder legislation passed in June, some of those funds would be redirected to help pay city debt, but Christie has not signed the bills yet. He could veto them, strip some measures out or allow them to go into effect automatically without his signature when the state Assembly comes back into session.\nOne big outstanding bill is the $88 million the city owes to the Borgata Hotel, Casino & Spa for a property tax settlement agreement. The city is paying $150,000 a month but hoping to negotiate, through the emergency manager, a deal to pay down the rest without having to borrow.\nA spokesman for Lavin did not reply to a request for comment.

That prompted Shire to file a series of lawsuits in 2011 and 2012.\nIn June 2014, Shire won summary judgment in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey that its 16 patents on the drug were valid and would be infringed by the planned generics, prompting the generic drugmakers to appeal.\n\"We are extremely pleased that the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling that the patents are valid, which further confirms that Shire has strong patents protecting Vyvanse,\" said Mark Enyedy, Shire's interim general counsel, in a press release.\nRepresentatives of Roxane and Amneal declined to comment. The other generic drugmakers did not immediately return requests for comment.\nVyvanse is approved by the FDA to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder.
