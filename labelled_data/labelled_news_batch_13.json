Learn more... \nSun, Aug 16, 2015, 19:12 BST - UK Markets closed Israel government approves major offshore gas deal AFP – 32 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe Israeli government Sunday approved a major deal with a consortium including US firm Noble Energy (NYSE: NBL - news ) on natural offshore gas production in the Mediterranean, the prime minister's office said. \nThe agreement, which was announced on Thursday and is expected to face a parliamentary vote, aims to end months of uncertainty and set a framework for the exploitation of gas discoveries. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is expected to raise major new government revenues and could provide Israel with strategic leverage in the region if it begins to export gas. \n\"This money will benefit education, health, social welfare and other national needs,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ahead of the cabinet vote, which passed 17-1. \nNoble and locally based firm Delek have since 2013 produced gas from the Tamar field off the Israeli coast. \nThey have also teamed up to develop the offshore Leviathan field, considered the largest in the Mediterranean. \nThe agreement approved Sunday contains amendments to an earlier version, such as linking the price of gas to an energy index, which is meant to lower costs for consumers. \nThe consortium committed to invest $1.5 billion to develop the Leviathan field over the next two years. \nIsrael has agreed not to change fiscal and regulatory rules related to the gas industry for a decade as long as the consortium abides by its commitments. \nThe talks have been controversial, with many fearing the deal would overly favour the companies involved. \nThe agreement notes that Israel's anti-trust authority objects to it on the grounds that it does not allow for sufficient competition. \nTo circumvent that obstacle, Netanyahu's inner cabinet in June declared gas production to be linked to national security, thus allowing the government to override laws related to monopolies. \nNetanyahu has pushed hard to speed up gas production in the Mediterranean, drawing criticism from political opponents who accuse him of not ensuring sufficient benefits for the Israeli public in the negotiations. \n\"The true interests of the state of Israel require the approval of this outline as quickly as possible,\" he said on Sunday, while declaring he was \"not impressed by populism\".",

Learn more... \nSun, Aug 16, 2015, 19:12 BST - UK Markets closed Israel government approves major offshore gas deal AFP – 32 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe Israeli government Sunday approved a major deal with a consortium including US firm Noble Energy (NYSE: NBL - news ) on natural offshore gas production in the Mediterranean, the prime minister's office said. \nThe agreement, which was announced on Thursday and is expected to face a parliamentary vote, aims to end months of uncertainty and set a framework for the exploitation of gas discoveries. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is expected to raise major new government revenues and could provide Israel with strategic leverage in the region if it begins to export gas. \n\"This money will benefit education, health, social welfare and other national needs,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ahead of the cabinet vote, which passed 17-1. \nNoble and locally based firm Delek have since 2013 produced gas from the Tamar field off the Israeli coast. \nThey have also teamed up to develop the offshore Leviathan field, considered the largest in the Mediterranean. \nThe agreement approved Sunday contains amendments to an earlier version, such as linking the price of gas to an energy index, which is meant to lower costs for consumers. \nThe consortium committed to invest $1.5 billion to develop the Leviathan field over the next two years. \nIsrael has agreed not to change fiscal and regulatory rules related to the gas industry for a decade as long as the consortium abides by its commitments. \nThe talks have been controversial, with many fearing the deal would overly favour the companies involved. \nThe agreement notes that Israel's anti-trust authority objects to it on the grounds that it does not allow for sufficient competition. \nTo circumvent that obstacle, Netanyahu's inner cabinet in June declared gas production to be linked to national security, thus allowing the government to override laws related to monopolies. \nNetanyahu has pushed hard to speed up gas production in the Mediterranean, drawing criticism from political opponents who accuse him of not ensuring sufficient benefits for the Israeli public in the negotiations. \n\"The true interests of the state of Israel require the approval of this outline as quickly as possible,\" he said on Sunday, while declaring he was \"not impressed by populism\".",

Learn more... \nMon, Aug 17, 2015, 16:52 BST - UK Markets closed Norwegian fund excludes four Asian companies over palm oil AFP – 3 minutes 44 seconds ago View Photo \n\nNorway's gigantic sovereign wealth fund announced Monday it is divesting from four large Asian companies over the environmental damage their palm oil activities have on tropical forests. \nThe world's largest public investment fund managing 7.1 billion kroner(785 billion euros, $872 billion) in Norwegian wealth said its decision to exclude four groups -- including South Korean group Daewoo International (KSE: 047050.KS - news ) -- from its portfolio was based on \"an assessment of the risk of severe environmental damage\" from their conversion of tropical forests to cultivate palm oil. \nDaewoo and South Korean steelmaker Posco (KSE: 005490.KS - news ) , and Malaysian groups Genting and IJM, were targeted in the divestment decision by Norway's central bank, which manages the wealth fund that owns around 1.3 percent of all stocks on global equity markets. \nThe fund manages its investments according to strict ethical guidelines that had previously led it to exclude around 60 companies from its holdings, including Airbus, Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) , Safran (Paris: FR 73272 - news ) , Philip Morris and Wal-Mart. \nThose moves by the fund -- which draws investment money from Norway's huge oil revenues -- are frequently replicated by other international investors concerned about ethical perceptions of their holdings. \nDaewoo fell afoul of fund managers for its 85 percent stake in an Indonesian company responsible for clearing enormous swathes of the country's tropical forest for palm oil cultivation. \nAt the end of 2014 the fund owned 0.91 percent of Posco worth $198 million, and 0.28 percent of Daewoo valued at $9 million. \nIts 0.4 percent stake in Genting was worth around $41 million, and its 1.6 percent position in IJM was estimated at $46 million.",

It owned 24.9 percent of the company in December, when the Treasury began to cut its stake in stages.\n“I am determined to build on this success, and to continue to return Lloyds to the private sector and reduce our national debt,” Osborne said.\nThe sale comes ahead of a planned offering to retail investors in the next year and the sale of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. U.K. Financial Investments Ltd., which manages the taxpayer’s 78 percent stake in RBS, could appoint investment banks to handle the sale on Monday, or another day this week, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday.\nThe stake sold is worth about 595 million pounds, according to the share price Friday. The shares rose 0.4 percent to 83.56 pence at 9:22 a.m. in London, valuing the company at 59.7 billion pounds.\nLloyds said the success in selling the latest stake demonstrated progress made in restructuring the bank.\n“This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper,” Lloyds said in a statement.\nThe government could recoup 5.3 billion pounds more than the money it injected into Lloyds, including cash and fees it received from the firm, Rothschild analysts estimated in a June report.\nThe bank reported first-half profit of 1.2 billion pounds last week, missing analysts’ estimates, as it took a 1.4 billion-pound charge for improperly selling loan insurance.",

We no longer have a democracy ... but a Eurozone dictatorship.\" \nHe and 12 other left-wing politicians are intending to start a rival anti-austerity movement to Syriza - but have not quit their current party outright so far. \nHowever, Mr Tsipras has defended the bailout plan, explaining: \"We took a painful decision of responsibility, and took a step back. Our position cannot be served by escape or by fantasy. \n\"We took the decision to remain alive instead of committing suicide and complaining how unfair it was.\" \nGreece needs to complete the bailout deal with all relevant parties by 20 August, as this is when a €3.2bn debt repayment to the European Central Bank is due. \nHowever, there is a contingency plan in case the bailout deal is not achieved, as the European Commission has been told to draw up proposals for an interim loan which would allow Greece to pay its bills if Eurozone members reject the plan.",

So bad that a medium-sized unit of Greece’s largest bank is now worth more than its owner.\nToday’s 30 percent rout in National Bank of Greece puts the lender’s market capitalization at about 2.97 billion euros ($3.26 billion). Finansbank AS, owned by NBG and only the seventh-largest among peers on the Borsa Istanbul, trades at about 3 billion euros.\n\\r The reversal is all the more striking considering Turkey is mired in political turmoil of its own. Turkey has been without a government for 56 days after inconclusive elections, and the interim cabinet is tangled in a two-front war against Islamic State fighters and Kurds on its border.\n“The fact that NBG’s market cap fell below that of its Turkish subsidiary Finansbank emphasizes the state of disarray and confusion that continues to reign in Greece,” said Stuart Hackett, a trader at Istanbul brokerage Oyak.\nWith the lira down 7 percent this year, the currency in which Finansbank trades is also one of the few major currencies to have lost value against the euro in 2015.\nFinansbank is also shoring up its parent’s earnings. While NBG posted a 66 million-euro profit last year, the Turkey unit contributed 318 million euros to that, according to an investor presentation .",

        "text_full": "Biggest Greek Bank Sinks So Much Its Turkey Unit Now Dwarfs It\nHow bad is investor confidence in Athens? So bad that a medium-sized unit of Greece’s largest bank is now worth more than its owner.\nToday’s 30 percent rout in National Bank of Greece puts the lender’s market capitalization at about 2.97 billion euros ($3.26 billion). Finansbank AS, owned by NBG and only the seventh-largest among peers on the Borsa Istanbul, trades at about 3 billion euros.\n\\r The reversal is all the more striking considering Turkey is mired in political turmoil of its own. Turkey has been without a government for 56 days after inconclusive elections, and the interim cabinet is tangled in a two-front war against Islamic State fighters and Kurds on its border.\n“The fact that NBG’s market cap fell below that of its Turkish subsidiary Finansbank emphasizes the state of disarray and confusion that continues to reign in Greece,” said Stuart Hackett, a trader at Istanbul brokerage Oyak.\nWith the lira down 7 percent this year, the currency in which Finansbank trades is also one of the few major currencies to have lost value against the euro in 2015.\nFinansbank is also shoring up its parent’s earnings. While NBG posted a 66 million-euro profit last year, the Turkey unit contributed 318 million euros to that, according to an investor presentation .",

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday staked out her opposition to Arctic oil exploration, a day after the Obama administration gave Royal Dutch Shell final approval to drill off Alaska. \n\"The Arctic is a unique treasure,\" Clinton said in a Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) post. \"Given what we know, it's not worth the risk of drilling.\" \nOn Monday, the Obama administration gave Shell final approval to resume drilling into the oil zone off northern Alaska for the first time since 2012. \nShell obtained the leases during the administration of former President George W. Bush. \nArctic drilling is sure to be a contentious issue in the presidential campaign as more Arctic lease sales are scheduled for 2016 and 2017. \nEnvironmentalists oppose the drilling, saying any spill would harm walruses, whales, and polar bears in a region scientists say is already vulnerable to climate change. \nThe Arctic contains 20 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and gas, the U.S. government estimates, making it a coveted resource. \nShell suffered a series of mishaps in 2012 in the Arctic, including losing control of an oil rig from which Coast Guard divers dropped from helicopters had to rescue 18 crew members. But the company says Arctic oil, which would not be produced for at least a decade, is needed to meet growing global demand. \nOn other energy issues, Clinton has sought to balance environmental and economic concerns. Previously she said she would seek to phase out fossil fuel extraction and increase fees on companies operating on public lands in a way that does not disrupt the economy, if she becomes president. \nClinton has been careful not to comment on whether she would approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada ahead of an expected ruling by President Barack Obama.

Bush. \nArctic drilling is sure to be a contentious issue in the presidential campaign as more Arctic lease sales are scheduled for 2016 and 2017. \nEnvironmentalists oppose the drilling, saying any spill would harm walruses, whales, and polar bears in a region scientists say is already vulnerable to climate change. \nThe Arctic contains 20 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and gas, the U.S. government estimates, making it a coveted resource. \nShell suffered a series of mishaps in 2012 in the Arctic, including losing control of an oil rig from which Coast Guard divers dropped from helicopters had to rescue 18 crew members. But the company says Arctic oil, which would not be produced for at least a decade, is needed to meet growing global demand. \nOn other energy issues, Clinton has sought to balance environmental and economic concerns. Previously she said she would seek to phase out fossil fuel extraction and increase fees on companies operating on public lands in a way that does not disrupt the economy, if she becomes president. \nClinton has been careful not to comment on whether she would approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada ahead of an expected ruling by President Barack Obama.

The drivers want to be considered employees rather than independent contractors at the smartphone-based startup. \nDrivers for the company have to comply with \"a litany of detailed requirements imposed on them by Uber,\" and so should get the protections and benefits of employees in the state, the complaint from drivers said. \n\"The drivers' services are fully integrated into Uber's business, and without the drivers, Uber's business would not exist,\" the complaint said. \nA California panel ruled last month that a driver for the service was entitled to employee benefits, a decision Uber has appealed. \nIf such decisions were applied to all the company's drivers it could potentially take away one of the underpinnings of Uber's business model and cut into profits. \nUber argues that it has no one particular driver type, and its flexibility in work means drivers are independent contractors. \nA lot of drivers \"enjoy the flexibility and autonomy and independence that the Uber app provides,\" said attorney Theodore Boutrous who is representing the company. \n\"It could have real devastating consequences. One driver said it would ruin his business,\" he added. \nUber has seen massive growth with its popular geolocation taxi service, ballooning to a valuation of some $50 billion. \nBut its aggressive business model and competitive pricing have raised ire in some US states and other countries. \nLocal taxi companies have staged protests, including in France where a nationwide taxi strike against Uber turned violent, prompting a suspension of its low-cost service.",

The drivers want to be considered employees rather than independent contractors at the smartphone-based startup. \nDrivers for the company have to comply with \"a litany of detailed requirements imposed on them by Uber,\" and so should get the protections and benefits of employees in the state, the complaint from drivers said. \n\"The drivers' services are fully integrated into Uber's business, and without the drivers, Uber's business would not exist,\" the complaint said. \nA California panel ruled last month that a driver for the service was entitled to employee benefits, a decision Uber has appealed. \nIf such decisions were applied to all the company's drivers it could potentially take away one of the underpinnings of Uber's business model and cut into profits. \nUber argues that it has no one particular driver type, and its flexibility in work means drivers are independent contractors. \nA lot of drivers \"enjoy the flexibility and autonomy and independence that the Uber app provides,\" said attorney Theodore Boutrous who is representing the company. \n\"It could have real devastating consequences. One driver said it would ruin his business,\" he added. \nUber has seen massive growth with its popular geolocation taxi service, ballooning to a valuation of some $50 billion. \nBut its aggressive business model and competitive pricing have raised ire in some US states and other countries. \nLocal taxi companies have staged protests, including in France where a nationwide taxi strike against Uber turned violent, prompting a suspension of its low-cost service.",

And he'll do it at Dreamforce, the huge annual conference for cloud computing company Salesforce. \nSo said Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff during his quarterly conference call with Wall Street analysts. \nBenioff was talking about all the big name guests taking the stage during the Dreamforce show in San Francisco, September 15-18. \nThat's when he mentioned: \"George Zimmer will launching his new company zTux and zTailors.\" \nZimmer made headlines in 2013 when his board ousted him and grabbed control of the company he founded, Men's Warehouse. \nA year later, he appeared at Dreamforce to tease his new company, which he launched in March called zTailors . That's an app that lets you find a tailor and schedule that tailor to do a house call. \nBut he was also supposedly working on another business, alternatively called Generation Tux and zTux, reports Erin Griffin at Fortune . It lets you rent tuxedos with an app. Zimmer was trying to raise a $22 million Series A, Griffin reports and noted that zTux sounded a lot like Black Tux, a company that Zimmer had reportedly tried to invest in but was turned down. \nLooks like zTux will make its first formal appearance at Dreamforce.",

And he'll do it at Dreamforce, the huge annual conference for cloud computing company Salesforce. \nSo said Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff during his quarterly conference call with Wall Street analysts. \nBenioff was talking about all the big name guests taking the stage during the Dreamforce show in San Francisco, September 15-18. \nThat's when he mentioned: \"George Zimmer will launching his new company zTux and zTailors.\" \nZimmer made headlines in 2013 when his board ousted him and grabbed control of the company he founded, Men's Warehouse. \nA year later, he appeared at Dreamforce to tease his new company, which he launched in March called zTailors . That's an app that lets you find a tailor and schedule that tailor to do a house call. \nBut he was also supposedly working on another business, alternatively called Generation Tux and zTux, reports Erin Griffin at Fortune . It lets you rent tuxedos with an app. Zimmer was trying to raise a $22 million Series A, Griffin reports and noted that zTux sounded a lot like Black Tux, a company that Zimmer had reportedly tried to invest in but was turned down. \nLooks like zTux will make its first formal appearance at Dreamforce.",

Pre-tax profit for the six months ended 30 June was £186.1m, up from £184.9m in the first half of 2014 and beating consensus expectations for a drop in profit to around £163m. \nEarnings per share were up 4% to 54.8p while the interim dividend was lifted 3% to 51p per share, ahead of forecasts of 47p per share. \nGroup customers rose 6% to 4.19m and profit in the UK car insurance division grew 6% to £219.2m, mainly on the back of higher reserve releases. \nThe combined ratio came in at 82.7%, down from 85.1% in the same period last year. \nChief executive officer Henry Engelhardt said: \"A good start to a challenging year. Profits are up, customer numbers are up, earnings per share is up, the dividend is up ... you might say it was a pretty 'up' first half! \"The UK business turned in a very solid result helped by positive claims cost development, with modest growth accompanying price increases. Overall I'd say, it has been a good first half.\" Engelhardt highlighted the strong performance of the group's Italian business, ConTe, noting that it delivered an accounting profit for the half year and that improved loss ratio projections show the operation was profitable in 2012 on a written basis. \nShore Capital said the interims were better than its top-of-the range forecasts, reflecting the impact of an 83% combined ratio, which offset a reduction of around 9% in ancillary income and a loss from price comparison divisions (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

Gary Pechie, director of the Labor Department's wage and workplace standards division, said a representative of the association apologized and a meeting with the Department of Labor is being arranged. \nWorkers were paid in cash with no payroll records, wages were below the hourly minimum wage of $9.15 and overtime was unpaid, Pechie said. Some workers were illegally paid as little as $4 an hour, he said. Employers avoided unemployment insurance, income and sales tax payments, he said. \nThe nail and spa industry in Connecticut has \"kind of been under the radar,\" Pechie said, but officials acted following complaints and a news story published recently by The New York Times detailing wage and hour abuse allegations in New York. \n\"Let's do a random sweep,\" Pechie recounted. \"Lo and behold, we found noncompliance.\"",

Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of March to $149,735.\nNet investment and derivative gains plummeted 94 percent to $123 million from $2.06 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire shed its 40-year stake in former Washington Post publisher Graham Holdings Co.\nAccounting rules require Berkshire to report investment and derivative gains and losses with earnings. Buffett considers the amounts in any given quarter irrelevant, and not reflective of Berkshire's business performance.\nProfit from insurance, Berkshire's best-known operating sector, fell 39 percent to $939 million, and included a $38 million underwriting loss.\nMuch of that weakening stemmed from the Geico car insurance business. Its pretax underwriting gain fell 87 percent to $53 million from $393 million, as it paid out a higher percentage of premiums to cover claims. Berkshire said it is boosting premium rates \"as needed\" as a result.\nMeanwhile, a Berkshire business that insures against major catastrophes suffered a $411 million pretax underwriting loss, reflecting currency fluctuations and a storm loss in Australia.\nBerkshire Class A shares closed down $187.24 at $215,462.76, and its Class B shares rose 20 cents to $143.55.

(AP) -- Los Angeles has agreed to give up LA/Ontario International Airport, returning the struggling complex to local control after three decades and ending a long legal battle, it was announced Thursday. \nThe tentative deal disclosed by the mayors of the two cities calls for Ontario to pay Los Angeles World Airports $190 million over 10 years to reimburse it for the cost of running and improving the airport located 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. \nThe Ontario International Airport Authority also will assume airport debts, bringing the cost of the deal to about $250 million. \nThe agreement also requires Ontario to take steps to protect jobs of airport employees. \nThe deal still requires approval from both city councils, both airport authorities and the Federal Aviation Administration. The process is expected to start in October and take about a year. \n\"I have supported the transfer of ONT to local control since my first day in office and I am thrilled that we can stop litigation and focus on a partnership that expands Southern California's commitment to superior air travel,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. \nThe deal will \"restore the region's most important economic and jobs engine,\" Ontario Mayor pro tem Alan D. Wapner said. \nOntario turned over airport operations to Los Angeles in 1967 and sold it outright in 1985. \nIn recent years the facility has seen passenger totals decline and lost airlines. The passenger count fell from 7.2 million in 2007 to 3.9 million in 2013, although it rebounded slightly last year. \nThe facility now has around 60 daily departures by eight carriers. \nOntario sued two years ago for breach of contract. It blamed airport woes on neglect and deliberate actions by Los Angeles World Airports, which also operates Los Angeles International Airport and Van Nuys Airport. \nThe airport operator denied it was attempting to reduce Ontario's business in favor of LAX. The lawsuit was scheduled to have gone to trial on Aug. 17.",

There is a promise of recapitalisation of the banks, without any of the depositors having to bail in or anything to worry about,\" he told reporters. \n\"The process of reversing the negative effects of capital controls will start very quickly and will speedily return the banks to where they were before, hopefully on a far firmer footing,\" Tsakalotos said. \nThe comments came after finance ministers from the euro zone agreed, after six hours of talks, to lend Greece up to 86 billion euros. \nHowever Tsakalotos said the success of the country's third bailout will depend on how Greeks respond to the challenges of tough reforms. \n\"Any deal is only as good as what you make of it. Let's hope the Greek people will be able to make the best of this deal,\" he said. \nTsakalotos also praised his fellow Greeks and the creditors for their efforts, striking a different tone from his predecessor Yanis Varoufakis, who angered other EU leaders with his brash approach. \n\"This agreement is one that many have worked hard for.

His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nProsecutors said McPhail learned secret information about American Superconductor from an unnamed senior executive who, like him, belonged to the Oakley Country Club in Watertown, Massachusetts.\nDespite hearing the information in confidence, McPhail starting in 2009 began sharing with his friends the inside information about the company's business activities and earnings announcements, prosecutors said.\nOver a two-year period, McPhail's friends made over $500,000 by illegally trading on the tips, prosecutors said. Parigian alone made more than $267,000, prosecutors have said.\nThe trial and Parigian's plea came after Casper rejected a bid to dismiss the case in light of a December ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that curtailed authorities' ability to pursue insider trading.\nWhile the decision, which reversed the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, only applied to judges in New York, Vermont and Connecticut, defendants in other states have sought to take advantage of it in their cases.\nParigian's plea deal allows him to appeal Casper's decision. The U.S. Justice Department has meanwhile petitioned the Supreme Court to review the 2nd Circuit's ruling.\nThe case is U.S. v.

Investors and dealers use swaps as another way to bet for or against bonds as well as to hedge their portfolios.\nDue to their importance, regulators required dealers and investors by 2014 to book their interest rate swaps with clearinghouses or centralized counterparties like those operated by the CME and its larger rival LCH.Clearnet.\nCME, the world's largest futures exchange operator, owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange and other markets.\n(Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Christian Plumb )",

        "text": "LONDON Aug 17 Spanish, Italian and Portuguese bond yields fell on Monday, with lower-rated euro zone assets buoyed by a third bailout deal for Greece and a relatively stable Chinese yuan.\nEuro zone finance ministers agreed to lend Greece up to 86 billion euros ($96 billion) after Greek lawmakers accepted their tough conditions despite a revolt by some members of the party of leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.\nInvestors are assuming no problems with the next stage of the process in which German and other parliaments have to vote on the deal, and expect 13 billion euros to be disbursed to Athens by Thursday to cover a debt payment to the European Central Bank.\nIn China, where worries of an economic slowdown have weighed on riskier assets, stock markets were volatile but the yuan was relatively stable. The People's Bank of China on Monday , set the yuan's midpoint at 6.3969, a touch firmer than the previous session's fix of 6.3975.\nOil prices fell to near six-year lows, keeping inflation expectations subdued and adding downward pressure on yields.\nSpanish 10-year bond yields fell 5 basis points to 1.97 percent. Italian and Portuguese yields were down by a similar amount at 1.77 percent and 2.38 percent, respectively.\n\"The eurogroup agreement ... for Greece has helped sentiment and risk markets have stabilised somewhat,\" said Nick Stamenkovic, bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets.\nGerman 10-year Bund yields were a touch higher at 0.66 percent.\nCommerzbank rate strategist Michael Leister expected them to climb towards 0.75 percent, given the relative stabilisation in Chinese markets and the Greek bailout being on track.

The People's Bank of China on Monday , set the yuan's midpoint at 6.3969, a touch firmer than the previous session's fix of 6.3975.\nOil prices fell to near six-year lows, keeping inflation expectations subdued and adding downward pressure on yields.\nSpanish 10-year bond yields fell 5 basis points to 1.97 percent. Italian and Portuguese yields were down by a similar amount at 1.77 percent and 2.38 percent, respectively.\n\"The eurogroup agreement ... for Greece has helped sentiment and risk markets have stabilised somewhat,\" said Nick Stamenkovic, bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets.\nGerman 10-year Bund yields were a touch higher at 0.66 percent.\nCommerzbank rate strategist Michael Leister expected them to climb towards 0.75 percent, given the relative stabilisation in Chinese markets and the Greek bailout being on track.
