That was in line with the industry group the American Petroleum Institute's late-Tuesday report. \nAnalysts had expected an increase of 1 million barrels. \nIn other financial markets, a rebound on Wall Street helped soothe investors' tattered nerves, while the dollar rallied as risk aversion eased. \nData released on Wednesday showed U.S. non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft increased 2.2 percent in July, the biggest rise since June last year and handily beating expectations. \n(Reporting by Meeyoung Cho; Editing by Joseph Radford)",

That was in line with the industry group the American Petroleum Institute's late-Tuesday report. \nAnalysts had expected an increase of 1 million barrels. \nIn other financial markets, a rebound on Wall Street helped soothe investors' tattered nerves, while the dollar rallied as risk aversion eased. \nData released on Wednesday showed U.S. non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft increased 2.2 percent in July, the biggest rise since June last year and handily beating expectations. \n(Reporting by Meeyoung Cho; Editing by Joseph Radford)",

That&apos;s only the second time this has happened in the history of the index. May 15, 1940, marked the end of the last three-session period in which this occurred:\nBespoke Investment Group This string of sizable deviations from the 50-day moving average is a testament to just how severe recent losses have been compared to the index&apos;s recent range.\n\"Not even the crash of 1987 got this oversold relative to trend,\" writes Bespoke.\nThe money management and research firm produced a pair of analogue charts showing what&apos;s in store if the S&P 500 mimics the price action seen in mid-1940. Overlaying the axes gives the impression that the worst of the pain is behind us, and a market bottom isn&apos;t too far off:\nBespoke Investment Group However, indexing the S&P 500 to five sessions prior to the tumult shows that a replication of the mid-1940 plunge could see equities run much further to the downside and into a bear market:\nBespoke Investment Group If it tracked the 1940 trajectory, the S&P 500 would hit a low of 1,556 in relatively short order. But Bespoke doesn&apos;t think stocks are fated to repeat that selloff.\n\"There is nothing, nothing , we have seen - Chinese fears, positioning, valuation, or any other factor - suggests to us that we are headed to 1556,\" the analysts write. \"More likely, in our view, is something along the lines of the top analogue; we doubt the bottom is in, but see it unlikely we enter a bear market and a true stock market crash.\"",

That&apos;s only the second time this has happened in the history of the index. May 15, 1940, marked the end of the last three-session period in which this occurred:\nBespoke Investment Group This string of sizable deviations from the 50-day moving average is a testament to just how severe recent losses have been compared to the index&apos;s recent range.\n\"Not even the crash of 1987 got this oversold relative to trend,\" writes Bespoke.\nThe money management and research firm produced a pair of analogue charts showing what&apos;s in store if the S&P 500 mimics the price action seen in mid-1940. Overlaying the axes gives the impression that the worst of the pain is behind us, and a market bottom isn&apos;t too far off:\nBespoke Investment Group However, indexing the S&P 500 to five sessions prior to the tumult shows that a replication of the mid-1940 plunge could see equities run much further to the downside and into a bear market:\nBespoke Investment Group If it tracked the 1940 trajectory, the S&P 500 would hit a low of 1,556 in relatively short order. But Bespoke doesn&apos;t think stocks are fated to repeat that selloff.\n\"There is nothing, nothing , we have seen - Chinese fears, positioning, valuation, or any other factor - suggests to us that we are headed to 1556,\" the analysts write. \"More likely, in our view, is something along the lines of the top analogue; we doubt the bottom is in, but see it unlikely we enter a bear market and a true stock market crash.\"",

We have a three year agreement with them,\" Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe told Reuters.\nOptimum, which produces 10 million tonnes of coal a year, is under financial strain because it says it was selling coal to Eskom for less than the cost of production.

It did not elaborate.\nFor the first half, SAIC said its net profit rose 4.4 percent year-on-year to 14.2 billion yuan ($2.2 billion).\nThe Shanghai-based automaker's revenue also increased 1.1 percent to 323 billion yuan from a year earlier on flat first-half vehicle sales.

It did not elaborate.\nFor the first half, SAIC said its net profit rose 4.4 percent year-on-year to 14.2 billion yuan ($2.2 billion).\nThe Shanghai-based automaker's revenue also increased 1.1 percent to 323 billion yuan from a year earlier on flat first-half vehicle sales.

Statscan revised the first quarter deficit up to C$18.15 billion - the second highest on record - from an initial C$17.47 billion.\nA strong gain in exports in June helped trim the trade in goods deficit to C$6.74 billion from C$7.07 billion in the first quarter.\nOverall exports of goods edged up C$680 million to C$128.83 billion, largely due to higher prices. Total imports of goods rose by C$350 million to C$135.57 billion, in part due to higher shipments of motor vehicles and parts.\nThe deficit on trade in services shrank by C$240 million to C$5.49 billion as non-residents increased their spending in Canada.

        "text": "Maverick Capital, the $9 billion investment firm led by Lee Ainslie, is speaking with investors about a quant-driven fund that will wager on stocks, according to a person briefed on the plan.\nThe Maverick Fundamental Quant fund would operate separately from Maverick’s main investment unit, the person said. It will use algorithms to analyze various hedge funds’ historical stock picks to predict how investments will fare. Though details aren’t final, the product probably will be offered with liquid terms that would make it accessible to retail investors, the person said.\nAinslie’s firm is expanding its offerings into computer-driven products as hedge funds increasingly look to machines to inform investment decisions. Maverick started using quantitative tools for its fundamental stock-picking in 2006, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information.\nFraser Seitel, a spokesman for New York-based Maverick, declined to comment on the firm’s plans.\nInvestment managers are seeking ways to profit from new sources of data and the availability of computing power. Investment firms like Point72 Asset Management have hired people to build teams that can distill “big data” into actionable investment advice. Others like Clifford Asness’s AQR Capital Management have raised billions of dollars by distilling complex computer-driven strategies, usually reserved for sophisticated investors, into mutual funds for the masses.\nMaverick’s new pool will draw data from sources such as regulatory filings to assess a wide range of hedge funds’ positions, the person said. The fund won’t mirror holdings in Maverick’s main fund, though Maverick will be part of the sample of managers surveyed. The fund will take roughly 100 long bets and make 100 wagers against companies’ stocks it thinks will decline, the person said.",

        "text_full": "Ainslie’s Maverick Said to Shop Quant-Driven Stock-Picking Fund\nMaverick Capital, the $9 billion investment firm led by Lee Ainslie, is speaking with investors about a quant-driven fund that will wager on stocks, according to a person briefed on the plan.\nThe Maverick Fundamental Quant fund would operate separately from Maverick’s main investment unit, the person said. It will use algorithms to analyze various hedge funds’ historical stock picks to predict how investments will fare. Though details aren’t final, the product probably will be offered with liquid terms that would make it accessible to retail investors, the person said.\nAinslie’s firm is expanding its offerings into computer-driven products as hedge funds increasingly look to machines to inform investment decisions. Maverick started using quantitative tools for its fundamental stock-picking in 2006, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information.\nFraser Seitel, a spokesman for New York-based Maverick, declined to comment on the firm’s plans.\nInvestment managers are seeking ways to profit from new sources of data and the availability of computing power. Investment firms like Point72 Asset Management have hired people to build teams that can distill “big data” into actionable investment advice. Others like Clifford Asness’s AQR Capital Management have raised billions of dollars by distilling complex computer-driven strategies, usually reserved for sophisticated investors, into mutual funds for the masses.\nMaverick’s new pool will draw data from sources such as regulatory filings to assess a wide range of hedge funds’ positions, the person said. The fund won’t mirror holdings in Maverick’s main fund, though Maverick will be part of the sample of managers surveyed. The fund will take roughly 100 long bets and make 100 wagers against companies’ stocks it thinks will decline, the person said.",

Learn more... \nThu, Aug 27, 2015, 08:08 BST - UK Markets close in 8 hrs 22 mins Iraqi Kurdistan says to begin payments to oil companies in Sept Reuters - UK Focus – 17 minutes ago 27.00 +2.00 \nERBIL, Iraq, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdistan said on Thursday it expected to begin making regular payments to oil-exporting companies in the first half of September, in an apparent attempt to reassure foreign oil companies operating in the autonomous region. \nIts Ministry of Natural Resources said in a statement that $75-$100 million of revenue from its direct crude oil sales would be allocated as payment on account to the companies. \nThe region has ramped up independent sales since mid-June while cutting allocations to Iraq's state oil firm SOMO in an escalating dispute over export rights and budget payments that resulted in companies going unpaid. \n\"Regular payments will allow the exporting companies to cover their ongoing expenses and plan for further investment in the oil fields, which will in turn boost production,\" the statement read. \n\"As oil export rises in early 2016, the KRG envisages making additional revenue available to the exporting IOCs to enable them to begin to catch up on the past receivables due under their production sharing contracts.\" \nGulf Keystone Petroleum said on Thursday it was owed $283 million for oil sales and other costs from the Kurdistan Regional Government. \nJune was the first month of large independent sales since December last year, when Kurdistan reached a deal with Baghdad to transfer an average of 550,000 bpd in 2015 in return for the reinstatement of budget payments. \nAn average of 516,745 bpd was exported from the Kurdistan region in July via pipeline to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in Turkey, of which only 71,017 bpd went to SOMO.

They said Third Point did not file for such clearance until Sept. 16, 2011.\nLoeb ultimately engineered the installation of current Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer to replace Carol Bartz.\nHe also won a board seat, which he relinquished in July 2013 when Third Point sold 40 million Yahoo shares to the Sunnyvale, California-based company at a large profit.\nLed by Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, the FTC majority found a \"significant public interest\" in ensuring that investors follow HSR rules that are enforced consistently and transparently.\n\"The public interest does not hinge on whether Third Point's acquisitions of Yahoo stock were likely to produce any competitive harm,\" the majority said.\nThe Republican dissenters, Maureen Ohlhausen and Joshua Wright, said that \"as a matter of prosecutorial discretion\" no punishment was warranted.\nThey said the majority's finding \"is likely to chill valuable shareholder advocacy\" by subjecting transactions that are \"highly unlikely\" to raise antitrust issues to heightened disclosure requirements.

The recent developments could lead to some downgrades to the ECB’s consumer-price forecasts, which are due next month.\nConstancio said the central bank’s quantitative easing program to buy 60 billion euros ($69 billion) a month of euro-area debt is “open ended.”\nAt the same time, he said the slide in euro-area inflation expectations in August was due mainly to renewed declines in oil prices and is not in itself a cause for further action, such as extending the duration of QE beyond its initial end-date of September 2016.\n“Monetary policy cannot and should not try to correct, because those effects will disappear one day,” he said. “ The price of oil will not go down to zero.”",

The recent developments could lead to some downgrades to the ECB’s consumer-price forecasts, which are due next month.\nConstancio said the central bank’s quantitative easing program to buy 60 billion euros ($69 billion) a month of euro-area debt is “open ended.”\nAt the same time, he said the slide in euro-area inflation expectations in August was due mainly to renewed declines in oil prices and is not in itself a cause for further action, such as extending the duration of QE beyond its initial end-date of September 2016.\n“Monetary policy cannot and should not try to correct, because those effects will disappear one day,” he said. “ The price of oil will not go down to zero.”",

A Reuters reporter said there were smashed windows and damaged doors.\nIn a text message, an ENI spokesman played down the extent of the damage. \"Nobody wounded and no significant damage to the office buildings,\" he said.\nENI is still active in Libya, a major oil producer gripped by chaos and fighting. Like other Western companies, it has withdrawn expatriate staff.\nMellitah's biggest asset, El Feel oilfield, has been closed for months due to a protest by local security guards. The Wafa oil and gas field and its offshore operations are still working.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility.\nMilitants loyal to Islamic State have claimed a string of killings of foreigners as well as attacks on embassies and oilfields in Libya.\nIslamic State militants have exploited chaos in the North African country, where two governments allied to a host of armed groups are fighting for control four years after the ousting of veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi.

A Reuters reporter said there were smashed windows and damaged doors.\nIn a text message, an ENI spokesman played down the extent of the damage. \"Nobody wounded and no significant damage to the office buildings,\" he said.\nENI is still active in Libya, a major oil producer gripped by chaos and fighting. Like other Western companies, it has withdrawn expatriate staff.\nMellitah's biggest asset, El Feel oilfield, has been closed for months due to a protest by local security guards. The Wafa oil and gas field and its offshore operations are still working.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility.\nMilitants loyal to Islamic State have claimed a string of killings of foreigners as well as attacks on embassies and oilfields in Libya.\nIslamic State militants have exploited chaos in the North African country, where two governments allied to a host of armed groups are fighting for control four years after the ousting of veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi.

The change will be effective on Sept. 6.\nThe move comes after Chinese stock indexes nosedived more than 7 percent, hitting their lowest levels since December, following their more than 8 percent plunge on Monday.\nThe central bank shocked global markets by devaluing the yuan by nearly 2 percent on Aug. 11. The PBOC called it a free-market reform but some saw it as the start of a long-term yuan depreciation to spur exports. (Reporting by China Economics; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",

The change will be effective on Sept. 6.\nThe move comes after Chinese stock indexes nosedived more than 7 percent, hitting their lowest levels since December, following their more than 8 percent plunge on Monday.\nThe central bank shocked global markets by devaluing the yuan by nearly 2 percent on Aug. 11. The PBOC called it a free-market reform but some saw it as the start of a long-term yuan depreciation to spur exports. (Reporting by China Economics; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",

Horton Inc and Lennar Corp, have been able to raise prices as low mortgage rates and strong employment trends boost demand, putting the housing market on a path of steady recovery.\nThe average price at which Toll Brothers booked orders rose 16 percent to $834,000, the highest quarterly average in the company's history.\n\"This housing recovery appears to be built on a very solid foundation,\" Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said in a statement on Tuesday.\nToll Brothers targets customers who typically make at least $100,000 a year.\nThe company's net income fell to $66.7 million, or 36 cents per share, from $97.7 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue fell 2.7 percent to $1.03 billion.\nTo Monday's close of $38.06, Toll's shares had risen about 11 percent this year, slightly outpacing a rise of about 10 percent in the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction index.

The meeting comes as the aluminum company has ramped up public criticism of the regulator's intervention in the London Metal Exchange's (LME) warehousing reform plan.\nThe dispute highlights aluminum producers' concerns about the impact of LME rule changes on sinking prices. Recent LME reforms have increased the rate at which metal must be delivered out of warehouses, a response to controversial financing deals, and aluminum has flooded the market partly as a result.\nIn a letter late last month, Alcoa general counsel Max Laun asked the CFTC to retract a letter announcing its decision to delay ruling on the LME's application to register as a \"foreign board of trade\" in the United States.\nThe letter accused the CFTC of overstepping by attempting to regulate a foreign exchange while pushing for the LME, the world's oldest and biggest market for industrial metals owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd to introduce other reforms, including a cap on warehouse rents.\nLaun also requested a meeting between Massad and Alcoa Chief Financial Officer Bill Oplinger for the week of Monday, August 24. It was not immediately clear whether Oplinger or a different Alcoa representative would attend Wednesday's meeting.\nAlcoa, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, met with the CFTC several times before submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act in June to find out what had caused the CFTC to delay its decision on the LME, but those meetings had been with lower-level staff.

Advent and Bain may also choose to proceed with IPO plans and not sell the company and a decision may be announced as early as next month. \nAdvent and Bain Capital bought Worldpay from Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) in 2010 for £1.7bn.",

Bloomberg cited people familiar with the matter as saying the company is competing against private-equity bidders, including a joint proposal from Blackstone Group and Hellman & Friedman, as Worldpay also prepares for a possible initial public offering. \nWirecard's offer values Worldpay at about £6bn, or 17 times its projected earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation next year, according to Bloomberg. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said no final decision has been made and several potential buyers are still in the running. Advent and Bain may also choose to proceed with IPO plans and not sell the company and a decision may be announced as early as next month. \nAdvent and Bain Capital bought Worldpay from Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) in 2010 for £1.7bn.",

October -- the only other meeting on the 2015 calendar -- wasn’t part of the conversation, mainly because there’s no press conference scheduled along with the central bank’s interest-rate decision that day.\nNow that may be changing for some analysts after the recent financial-market turmoil. September may be too soon, and December is problematic in the eyes of some investors because liquidity in financial markets tends to dry up at that time of year. That puts October on the radar screen.\n“We have to look at it more seriously,” said David Keeble, the New York-based head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole SA. “You really want to be moving a little bit before December, otherwise your credibility starts to disappear,” said Keeble, who’s still projecting the Fed will boost its target next month for the first time since 2006.\nThe Fed has been signaling for months that it would raise interest rates this year, after holding its target near zero since 2008. The market was buying into that message until global equity markets lost more than $5 trillion of value in less than two weeks on expectations of slowing economic growth.\n“An off-cycle hike in October is a possibility if September is too soon because of market jitters,” said Greg Anderson, Bank of Montreal’s global head of foreign-exchange strategy.\nTraders see a 28 percent probability that the Fed will raise its target next month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That probability rises to 34 percent by the end of October, and jumps to 51 percent by the December gathering.\nYellen holds press conferences after every other Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\nSome traders see the lack of an October press conference as a dealbreaker.

Year-over-year, prices were up 5.0 percent in June, accelerating slightly from the 4.9 percent gain in the prior month. \nDavid Blitzer, head of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted the resilience in the housing market as unemployment has fallen and the Federal Reserve has held its near-zero interest rate policy since 2008 to support the US economy's recovery from the Great Recession. \nWith mortgage rates still near historic lows, home sales have been robust. Sales of 5.6 million existing homes in July hit their best pace since 2007 as inventory shrank, putting upward pressure on prices. Housing starts surged in July, and sales of new homes have been heading higher. \n\"These data point to a stronger housing sector to support the economy,\" said Blitzer. \nBut Blitzer noted possible clouds looming over the housing picture: the Fed's plan to raise its benchmark federal funds rate this year and volatility in the stock market. \n\"A one quarter-point increase in the Fed funds rate won't derail housing. However, if the Fed were to quickly follow that initial move with one or two more rate increases, housing and home prices might suffer,\" he said. \n\"A stock market correction is unlikely to do much damage to the housing market; a full-blown bear market dropping more than 20 percent would present some difficulties for housing and for other economic sectors (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"",

Year-over-year, prices were up 5.0 percent in June, accelerating slightly from the 4.9 percent gain in the prior month. \nDavid Blitzer, head of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted the resilience in the housing market as unemployment has fallen and the Federal Reserve has held its near-zero interest rate policy since 2008 to support the US economy's recovery from the Great Recession. \nWith mortgage rates still near historic lows, home sales have been robust. Sales of 5.6 million existing homes in July hit their best pace since 2007 as inventory shrank, putting upward pressure on prices. Housing starts surged in July, and sales of new homes have been heading higher. \n\"These data point to a stronger housing sector to support the economy,\" said Blitzer. \nBut Blitzer noted possible clouds looming over the housing picture: the Fed's plan to raise its benchmark federal funds rate this year and volatility in the stock market. \n\"A one quarter-point increase in the Fed funds rate won't derail housing. However, if the Fed were to quickly follow that initial move with one or two more rate increases, housing and home prices might suffer,\" he said. \n\"A stock market correction is unlikely to do much damage to the housing market; a full-blown bear market dropping more than 20 percent would present some difficulties for housing and for other economic sectors (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"",

He steered the insurer through the financial crisis while avoiding losses tied to subprime mortgages, and Travelers was added in 2009 to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nTravelers has declined 4.7 percent from Dec. 31 through yesterday after advancing for six straight years in New York trading. Fishman sought to assure investors Wednesday that the company was well prepared for succession.\nHe said that middlemen who sell Travelers policies to commercial clients are already comfortable dealing with Schnitzer. Many of New York-based company’s top managers, such as Chief Investment Officer Bill Heyman and Chief Financial Officer Jay Benet have been with the company for more than a decade.\nFishman will remain chairman. While he called ALS a “miserable disease,” he said he was fortunate to have support from his family and the company.\n“All things considered, I’m in a very lucky place, and I’m doing just fine,” he said.",

Sahara has previously said it had repaid 95 percent of its liability, which has not been accepted by the court. \nThe group has been trying to raise funds since Roy's arrest, but has failed in several of its bids in the past year to raise the money against its hotels and some other properties in India. \nLast month, the court had asked the regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which is seeking redress for the bond investors, to submit an application for the appointment of a receiver for the property auction. \nOn Monday, the Supreme Court gave Sahara a month's time to respond to its show cause notice, after which SEBI will get two weeks to file a rejoinder, the lawyer told reporters after the court hearing. \nSahara did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a lawyer for the group confirmed the court order. \n(Reporting by Aditi Shah and Suchitra Mohanty; Writing by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

The Tokyo-based company, which mainly does tramp services carrying bulk cargoes such as iron core, coal and grains, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the Nikkei report.\nShares of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the largest shareholder of Daiichi Chuo, slumped as much as 7.4 percent after the report. Mitsui O.S.K., also known as MOL, is seeking confirmation of the report on bankruptcy and can’t comment further now, Takafumi Shiina, a company spokesman, said by phone. MOL controlled 16.5 percent of Daiichi Chuo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nDaiichi Chuo shares fell 3.5 percent to 28 yen in Tokyo trading Monday, giving the company a market value of 11.7 billion yen. The company’s shares have declined 44 percent this year.",

Tiremakers and insurers led gains.\nThe Topix added 1.5 percent to 1,396.63 as of 9:01 a.m. in Tokyo, after tumbling 4.4 percent Tuesday to the lowest close since January. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1.5 percent to 17,191.71. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent yesterday, halting a five-day drop.\n“U.S. stocks have regained some calm from a panic situation,” said Chihiro Ohta, general manager of investment information at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “We expect a general rebound today focusing particularly on stocks that have been heavily sold.”\nE-mini futures on the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent. Equities in the world’s biggest stock market swung between gains and losses for much of Tuesday as health-care companies rebounded, while biotechnology shares erased an early rally and Apple Inc. dragged technology companies lower. Glencore Plc rose 17 percent in London, a day after the trader and miner’s record plunge intensified concern about how material companies are weathering the slump in commodity prices.\nThe Topix is on course for a 14 percent three-month retreat, only its second quarterly decline since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power. The measure has slumped 9.2 percent in September as concern about the slowdown in China and the Federal Reserve’s rate-increase plans spurred global financial-market turmoil.\nData Misses Japan’s industrial output fell 0.5 percent in August from a month earlier, according to a preliminary report Wednesday. Economists had expected a 1 percent increase. Data on retail sales also missed estimates.\nThe nation should assemble a stimulus package to shore up its economy before the central bank further cranks up a campaign of unprecedented easing, an adviser to Abe said Tuesday. The premier last week unveiled a three-pronged plan to revive growth. He vowed to expand national output by 20 percent, provide more support for child-rearing and bolster social security.",

In 2011, the bottom 10% of households were -9.0% worse off in terms of income than they were pre-crisis. Since then, it hasn’t gotten any better: they now are making -11.6% less income than they were in 2007.\" \nCheck out the situation in the infographic below, and you can check out Desjardin's full post at the Visual Capitalist .",

Learn more... \nWed, Sep 30, 2015, 19:18 BST - UK Markets closed There are 9 million more people living in poverty now than before the Great Recession By Bob Bryan | Business Insider – 10 minutes ago Print \nIt seems that the constant refrain of economists recently is that the US is on pace for slow and steady growth, rebounding from the recession. \nFor the most part this seems true — unemployment is down, the housing market is improved, the underlying US economy seems to be in fair shape. \nWhat that view leaves out, says Jeff Desjardins at the Visual Capitalist , are a number of people struggling at the bottom. \n\"T hings are getting worse than pre-crisis levels for millions of the poorest Americans,\" wrote Desjardins. \n\"W hen we look at the lowest 10% of income earners, the situation is much more precarious. In 2011, the bottom 10% of households were -9.0% worse off in terms of income than they were pre-crisis. Since then, it hasn’t gotten any better: they now are making -11.6% less income than they were in 2007.\" \nCheck out the situation in the infographic below, and you can check out Desjardin's full post at the Visual Capitalist .",
