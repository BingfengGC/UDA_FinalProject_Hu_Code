        "text": "In recent years, the U.S. stock market has changed dramatically, thanks to an influx of regulatory, technological, and competitive pressures. The increasing complexity of the market has often been blamed for the technological glitches that appear to be occurring with some frequency on the country&apos;s stock exchanges.\nOn Wednesday, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading for three and a half hours to fix a computer malfunction. While NYSE is one of the biggest U.S. stock-trading venues, it is still just one of 11 exchanges and more than 50 private venues where American equities change hands. As Bloomberg News reported , while today’s issue affected transactions on NYSE&apos;s main market, and indexes derived from prices generated by that venue, investors could still buy and sell stock elsewhere.\nIn other words, all that stock market complexity has a silver lining . If one trading venue goes down, there will (hopefully) be plenty of alternatives still working.\nHere&apos;s a chart, published by Credit Suisse in 2013, illustrating the rising complexity of America&apos;s stock markets. The red dates show the advent of new stock trading venues, while blue indicates technological milestones and gray new regulation.\nSource: Credit Suisse (Not shown is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&apos;s recent effort to \"strengthen the technology infrastructure\" of the country&apos;s stock market.)",

The increasing complexity of the market has often been blamed for the technological glitches that appear to be occurring with some frequency on the country&apos;s stock exchanges.\nOn Wednesday, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading for three and a half hours to fix a computer malfunction. While NYSE is one of the biggest U.S. stock-trading venues, it is still just one of 11 exchanges and more than 50 private venues where American equities change hands. As Bloomberg News reported , while today’s issue affected transactions on NYSE&apos;s main market, and indexes derived from prices generated by that venue, investors could still buy and sell stock elsewhere.\nIn other words, all that stock market complexity has a silver lining . If one trading venue goes down, there will (hopefully) be plenty of alternatives still working.\nHere&apos;s a chart, published by Credit Suisse in 2013, illustrating the rising complexity of America&apos;s stock markets. The red dates show the advent of new stock trading venues, while blue indicates technological milestones and gray new regulation.\nSource: Credit Suisse (Not shown is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&apos;s recent effort to \"strengthen the technology infrastructure\" of the country&apos;s stock market.)",

Huffstutter \nCHICAGO, July 1 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Paine & Partners (Other OTC: PGPHF - news ) expanded its farm and agribusiness holdings on Wednesday with the acquisition of a leading European Union agricultural producer, Spearhead International Ltd, for an undisclosed amount. \nCambridge, England-based Spearhead has farm operations covering about 85,000 hectares under cultivation in the United Kingdom, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, with farms raising a variety of crops, including grains, oilseeds, vegetables, sugar beets, livestock and other crops. \nSpearhead is a key supplier to a number of multinational food companies, including PepsiCo Inc (NYSE: PEP - news ) , and has been developing its seed production business, according to Paine & Partners. \nPaine has had an interest in Spearhead \"for a significant period of time,\" President Kevin Schwartz told Reuters. When a large investor in Spearhead was looking to liquidate his investment, the fund took the opportunity to step in, Schwartz said. \nThe deal marks the latest move by the private equity sector into the global food and agricultural fields, amid mounting interest and threats facing the world's future food supply: intense competition for land; increasing demands on limited water resources among a rising global population; and the growing threat of volatile weather. \nJohn Atkin, former chief operating officer of Syngenta AG (Xetra: 580854 - news ) , will become chairman of Spearhead International, Schwartz said.

Huffstutter \nCHICAGO, July 1 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Paine & Partners (Other OTC: PGPHF - news ) expanded its farm and agribusiness holdings on Wednesday with the acquisition of a leading European Union agricultural producer, Spearhead International Ltd, for an undisclosed amount. \nCambridge, England-based Spearhead has farm operations covering about 85,000 hectares under cultivation in the United Kingdom, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, with farms raising a variety of crops, including grains, oilseeds, vegetables, sugar beets, livestock and other crops. \nSpearhead is a key supplier to a number of multinational food companies, including PepsiCo Inc (NYSE: PEP - news ) , and has been developing its seed production business, according to Paine & Partners. \nPaine has had an interest in Spearhead \"for a significant period of time,\" President Kevin Schwartz told Reuters. When a large investor in Spearhead was looking to liquidate his investment, the fund took the opportunity to step in, Schwartz said. \nThe deal marks the latest move by the private equity sector into the global food and agricultural fields, amid mounting interest and threats facing the world's future food supply: intense competition for land; increasing demands on limited water resources among a rising global population; and the growing threat of volatile weather. \nJohn Atkin, former chief operating officer of Syngenta AG (Xetra: 580854 - news ) , will become chairman of Spearhead International, Schwartz said.

        "text": "Investors that bet on a recovery after Greece restructured its debt have already lost a third of their money.\nAlmost 5.5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) has been wiped off the 15 billion-euro face value of Greek bonds held by asset managers from Pacific Investment Management Co. to Carmignac Gestion SA, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sovereign , financial and corporate notes sold since 2013 are now trading as low as 40 cents on the euro, the data show.\nLosses are set to worsen as Greece’s political and economic crisis deepens. A “no” vote in Sunday’s referendum on European bailout proposals may force the government to default on its debt and exit the euro, while a “yes” vote followed by a resignation of and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis could hinder legislative action needed to unlock international funds.\n“There’s no certainty on what will happen next week no matter which way the people vote,” said George Satlas, a fund manager at Eurobank Asset Management in Athens, which manages more than 4 billion euros. “In 2013 and 2014, bond yields in Greece were more attractive than anywhere else in Europe and international investors thought that the situation was stable. Nobody was expecting a resurgence of political risk.”\nPimco held 355 million euros of the new Greek bonds at the end of March, while Carmignac had 662 million euros as of May 29 and BlackRock Inc. had 207 million euros at the end of June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nJennifer Spivey, a spokeswoman for Pimco in London, declined to comment on the fund’s Greek holdings. A spokesman for Carmignac in London said that the nation’s debt represents 0.86 percent of the fund’s 58 billion euros under management.

        "text_full": "Greek Faith Costing Bond Investors $6 Billion as Crisis Deepens\nInvestors that bet on a recovery after Greece restructured its debt have already lost a third of their money.\nAlmost 5.5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) has been wiped off the 15 billion-euro face value of Greek bonds held by asset managers from Pacific Investment Management Co. to Carmignac Gestion SA, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sovereign , financial and corporate notes sold since 2013 are now trading as low as 40 cents on the euro, the data show.\nLosses are set to worsen as Greece’s political and economic crisis deepens. A “no” vote in Sunday’s referendum on European bailout proposals may force the government to default on its debt and exit the euro, while a “yes” vote followed by a resignation of and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis could hinder legislative action needed to unlock international funds.\n“There’s no certainty on what will happen next week no matter which way the people vote,” said George Satlas, a fund manager at Eurobank Asset Management in Athens, which manages more than 4 billion euros. “In 2013 and 2014, bond yields in Greece were more attractive than anywhere else in Europe and international investors thought that the situation was stable. Nobody was expecting a resurgence of political risk.”\nPimco held 355 million euros of the new Greek bonds at the end of March, while Carmignac had 662 million euros as of May 29 and BlackRock Inc. had 207 million euros at the end of June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nJennifer Spivey, a spokeswoman for Pimco in London, declined to comment on the fund’s Greek holdings. A spokesman for Carmignac in London said that the nation’s debt represents 0.86 percent of the fund’s 58 billion euros under management. An official at BlackRock in London wasn’t immediately able to comment on its holdings.",

(AP) -- A Shell Oil icebreaker has retreated after a showdown with environmental activists dangling from Portland, Oregon's tallest bridge. \nEnvironmental activists on St. Johns Bridge and kayakers on the water below have been blocking the icebreaker from heading to the Arctic for a drill operation. \nThe icebreaker Fennica arrived in Portland for repairs last week. The vessel was damaged earlier this month in the Aleutian Islands when it struck an underwater obstruction, tearing a gash in its hull. \nIt started its journey to the Arctic early Thursday before stalling in the face of 13 dangling activists linked by ropes. It then turned around to the delight of protesters gathered in a nearby park. \nThe U.S. Coast Guard warned the activists they were breaking the law, but took no action.",

Learn more... \nWed, Jul 1, 2015, 21:49 BST - UK Markets closed US stocks gain on hopes for Greece deal AFP – 41 minutes ago View Photo \n\nUS stocks gained Wednesday, following European equities higher on hopes for a deal with Greece as US data showed private-sector hiring accelerated in June. \nAt the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 17,761.05, up 141.54 points (0.80 percent). \nThe broad-based S&P 500 advanced 14.66 (0.71 percent) to 2,077.77, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 26.26 (0.53 percent) to 5,013.12. \nEuropean equities jumped as investors reacted positively to news of Greece's bid for a new bailout. Eurozone policy makers said they would not negotiate until Sunday's referendum in Greece on creditors' reforms. \n\"The market today took its cue from the European markets,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. \"We're basically hopeful of a deal.\" \nUS businesses added 237,000 jobs last month, up from 203,000 in May and the best level since December, according to payroll firm ADP. \nThe Department of Labor will release the official US jobs report for June on Thursday. Analysts expect a gain of 230,000 jobs.",

Its purchase options for 20 of the wide-body A350-900s remain unchanged, the airline said.\nThe carrier also brought forward the deliveries of some of the other A350-900s it has on order and can extend the leases on some A330-300s it has in service, to meet its fleet renewal and growth plans, SIA said.\nThe airline also has orders for Boeing 777-300ERs and 787-10s, as well as Airbus A380 superjumbos.\nOn Wednesday, the SIA Group reported a first-quarter net profit of S$91.2 million ($66.6 million) for the three months to end-June, up from S$34.8 million a year before. Revenues were up slightly at S$3.73 billion versus S$3.68 billion.\nOperating profit at the flagship full-service carrier increased to S$108 million from S$45 million, largely due to lower fuel costs and revenues from the sale of the seven production slots.\nSIA's long-haul low-cost subsidiary Scoot lost S$20 million during the quarter, down from a loss of S$25 million a year before, and its cargo business remained in the red.\nLooking ahead, SIA said that passenger and air cargo yields would remain under pressure in the July-September quarter due to a competitive environment and over-capacity.

He is due to be sentenced in June 2017. \n“Mr Stewart was an experienced trader at Rabobank who, through his guilty plea, has admitted to participating in a criminal conspiracy to manipulate Libor over a prolonged period of time. His behaviour was inexcusable and very serious,” said the FCA’s acting director of enforcement Georgina Phillippou. \n“This ban further reinforces our expectation that individuals and firms take responsibility for ensuring market integrity and reminds them of the consequences if they fall short of our standards.” \nMr Stewart is the second trader from the bank to be banned by the FCA his former colleague Paul Robson also faced action in March of this year.",

Chancellor George Osborne said he’ll start start returning Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc to private ownership in the coming months, even though it may come at a loss for the taxpayer. The government owns a 79 percent stake after bailing out the lender.\n“Today’s announcement shows the further progress made in returning Lloyds to full private ownership and enabling the taxpayer to get their money back,” the bank said in an e-mail. “This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank.”",

This is up from 32pc a year ago. \nThe rise means current accounts have become the new favourite target for fraudsters since Experian first started collating the data eight years ago. \nFraudulent mortgage applications, where individuals falsely inflate their income, had been the most common fraud, now been pushed into second place with 83 out of every 10,000 home loan applications deemed fraudulent, slightly up from 82 in 10,000 year-on-year. \nAccording to Experian the current account trend has emerged as criminals continue to probe for weaknesses in the seven day switching system, set to make it to encourage customers to move to better accounts. \nAs well as offering a quick win for fraudsters withdrawing overdraft facilities, current accounts can also offer criminals a stepping stone to apply for a wider range of financial products using stolen details, the firm said. \nNick Mothershaw, UK and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) director of identity and fraud at Experian, said: “It is important for people to take measures to ensure their details remain their own.

        "text": "DHAKA, July 5 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has upgraded its rating for Bangladesh, in a move that should make it easier for local entrepreneurs and banks to secure credit, the country's central bank governor said on Sunday.\nAtiur Rahman said the decision was made at a meeting of the Swiss Export Credit Agency last week, which he attended.\nHe said the OECD, an international group that promotes policies aimed at improving the economic and social well-bring of people around the world, had raised its country rating for Bangladesh by one notch to 5 from 6.\nThe decision reflected the resilience of Bangladesh economy, which has delivered strong growth for over a decade despite political upheaval and weak external demand, Atiur told Reuters.\nThe upgrade puts Bangladesh on a higher rating than neighboring countries such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar and Mongolia in the OECD country classification, though behind India.\nIt also means the OECD now categorises Bangladesh as a new frontier market, rather than a nation highly dependent on development aid.\nAtiur said the upgrade could encourage international lenders to take part in investment projects in Bangladesh including in infrastructure, textiles and apparel, pharmaceuticals and leather sectors.\nThe World Bank last week upgraded Bangladesh, Kenya, Myanmar, and Tajikistan to lower middle income countries from a previous classification of least developed countries.

China’s growing middle class is increasingly fond of European food which led to Italian restaurant chain Pizza Express being sold to China’s Hony Capital last year for £900m. \n“It’s been another busy year for the group, and the success of our newer brands is evident in the excellent growth figures that we are witnessing at present”, said Marcello Distefano, managing director at San Carlo. \n“We’re focused on maintaining this momentum, and are looking to offer our innovative concepts to new and exciting markets.” \nSan Carlo founder Carlo Distefano and his son Marcello \nSan Carlo also has a tie-up with Italian-born celebrity chef Aldo Zilli who has created a range of dishes for San Carlo’s Cicchetti restaurants. \nThe business continues to be family run by Sicilian-born Carlo Distefano, 71, and his son Marcello, who started the business in 2004. \nThe success of San Carlo is a tale of entrepreneurial success after Distefano arrived in Britain in 1962 aged 17 with just £12 loaned to him by his brother and a job at a barbershop.

The unit accounted for about 13 percent of Pfizer's total revenue.\nIbrance, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February, generated $140 million in revenue in the second quarter.\nPfizer's shares rose about 2 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday.\nThe drugmaker raised its adjusted profit forecast for 2015 to $2.01-$2.07 per share from $1.95-$2.05.\nIt increased the lower end of its revenue forecast to $45 billion from $44 billion, maintaining the upper end at $46 billion.\nPfizer, which got nearly two-thirds of its 2014 revenue from markets outside the United States, had cut its full-year revenue and profit forecast in April, citing a strong dollar.\nThe company's net income fell to $2.63 billion, or 42 cents per share, in the second quarter from $2.91 billion, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Pfizer earned 56 cents per share.\nRevenue fell 7 percent to $11.85 billion, hurt by a stronger dollar.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 52 cents per share and revenue of $11.42 billion, according to the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPfizer's shares were trading at $34.93 before the bell. The stock had risen 7 percent in the six months to June 30. (Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Jennings and Kirti Pandey)",

The unit accounted for about 13 percent of Pfizer's total revenue.\nIbrance, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February, generated $140 million in revenue in the second quarter.\nPfizer's shares rose about 2 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday.\nThe drugmaker raised its adjusted profit forecast for 2015 to $2.01-$2.07 per share from $1.95-$2.05.\nIt increased the lower end of its revenue forecast to $45 billion from $44 billion, maintaining the upper end at $46 billion.\nPfizer, which got nearly two-thirds of its 2014 revenue from markets outside the United States, had cut its full-year revenue and profit forecast in April, citing a strong dollar.\nThe company's net income fell to $2.63 billion, or 42 cents per share, in the second quarter from $2.91 billion, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Pfizer earned 56 cents per share.\nRevenue fell 7 percent to $11.85 billion, hurt by a stronger dollar.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 52 cents per share and revenue of $11.42 billion, according to the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPfizer's shares were trading at $34.93 before the bell. The stock had risen 7 percent in the six months to June 30. (Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Jennings and Kirti Pandey)",

Shipments mainly go through the southern ports of Santos and Paranagua, far from the main center-west grain belt.\nRegulatory changes in the past few years, however, have made room for private investments in new export terminals, notably in the north and northeast regions, which are closer to major grain growing areas.\nLast year, Bunge Ltd and ADM Co started new soy export routes from terminals in the municipality of Barcarena in the northern state of Para.\nLast week, a trading company controlled by Japan's Mitsui shipped non-transgenic soybeans from a new site in the northeastern state of Sergipe.\nThe Maranhao grains terminal on Wednesday also received a cargo train loaded with soybeans, the first time grains have arrived by rail at the site following the construction of a branch to allow for the use of a rail line that should cut operating costs in the exporting corridor.\n\"The rail line will account for around 80 percent of total volume transported to the terminal,\" said Santos.\nSilva said total volumes this year at Maranhao's Tegram should reach 2.5 million tonnes, mostly coming from farms in Tocantins and Mato Grosso.

Shipments mainly go through the southern ports of Santos and Paranagua, far from the main center-west grain belt.\nRegulatory changes in the past few years, however, have made room for private investments in new export terminals, notably in the north and northeast regions, which are closer to major grain growing areas.\nLast year, Bunge Ltd and ADM Co started new soy export routes from terminals in the municipality of Barcarena in the northern state of Para.\nLast week, a trading company controlled by Japan's Mitsui shipped non-transgenic soybeans from a new site in the northeastern state of Sergipe.\nThe Maranhao grains terminal on Wednesday also received a cargo train loaded with soybeans, the first time grains have arrived by rail at the site following the construction of a branch to allow for the use of a rail line that should cut operating costs in the exporting corridor.\n\"The rail line will account for around 80 percent of total volume transported to the terminal,\" said Santos.\nSilva said total volumes this year at Maranhao's Tegram should reach 2.5 million tonnes, mostly coming from farms in Tocantins and Mato Grosso.

He was eventually allowed to use a crew seat, the Brisbane Courier Mail reported. \nEtihad's lawyers last week attempted to have the case thrown out but District Court Judge Fleur Kingham refused their request and ordered Bassos to undergo a medical assessment. \nThe Abu Dhabi-based airline said it would continue to fight the lawsuit. \n\"Etihad Airways will continue to oppose the action and now that Mr Bassos will finally face a medical assessment in December 2015, as directed by court, we believe that the matter will proceed to an early conclusion,\" the carrier said in a statement Friday. \n\"The safety and comfort of Etihad Airways passengers and crew is of paramount importance and the airline has a zero tolerance policy towards unruly behaviour.\"",

He was eventually allowed to use a crew seat, the Brisbane Courier Mail reported. \nEtihad's lawyers last week attempted to have the case thrown out but District Court Judge Fleur Kingham refused their request and ordered Bassos to undergo a medical assessment. \nThe Abu Dhabi-based airline said it would continue to fight the lawsuit. \n\"Etihad Airways will continue to oppose the action and now that Mr Bassos will finally face a medical assessment in December 2015, as directed by court, we believe that the matter will proceed to an early conclusion,\" the carrier said in a statement Friday. \n\"The safety and comfort of Etihad Airways passengers and crew is of paramount importance and the airline has a zero tolerance policy towards unruly behaviour.\"",

But over a year later, the military has still not purchased a single compliant sneaker. \nThe Department of Defense says testing is underway and one version of New Balance's proposed shoe has already passed. \nSaucony, a sneaker company also developing an American made shoe, says the military needs a better testing regimen. An industry trade group says the delays are harming domestic shoemakers. \nAnd U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas says the department needs to step it up.",

With its competitive cost and design, Appomattox is next in our series of deepwater successes.\" \nShell said it had reduced the project's cost by 20 percent through design improvement and cost reductions, bringing its breakeven price to around $55 per barrel of oil equivalent.

Talks over London night tube service to restart By Aideen Kennedy | Sharecast – 5 minutes ago Print \nLONDON (ShareCast) - (ShareCast News) - Talks aimed at resolving the impasse over new all-night tube services in London will resume on Monday between transport chiefs and unions representing London Underground workers. The fresh negotiations, to be chaired by conciliation service Acas, will be aimed at avoiding further disruptions after the 24-hour strike last Thursday over terms and conditions for the introduction of 24-hour train services from 12 September. \nLondon's mayor Boris Johnson admitted that the introduction of the night service tube would face delay due to the dispute with unions. \n\"I want it starting in the autumn. What I am fussed about is the offer being put to union members,\" Johnson commented. \n\"I am not going to authorise any more money. Most people would recognise that this is a very generous deal.\" Last week the unions rejected a 2% salary increase, an extra £200 per night shift for drivers and a £500 bonus for Night Tube staff after accusing London Underground of being \"completely inflexible\" about the terms for the night tube, leaving them \"no other choice\" than to go ahead with the strike.",

Talks over London night tube service to restart By Aideen Kennedy | Sharecast – 5 minutes ago Print \nLONDON (ShareCast) - (ShareCast News) - Talks aimed at resolving the impasse over new all-night tube services in London will resume on Monday between transport chiefs and unions representing London Underground workers. The fresh negotiations, to be chaired by conciliation service Acas, will be aimed at avoiding further disruptions after the 24-hour strike last Thursday over terms and conditions for the introduction of 24-hour train services from 12 September. \nLondon's mayor Boris Johnson admitted that the introduction of the night service tube would face delay due to the dispute with unions. \n\"I want it starting in the autumn. What I am fussed about is the offer being put to union members,\" Johnson commented. \n\"I am not going to authorise any more money. Most people would recognise that this is a very generous deal.\" Last week the unions rejected a 2% salary increase, an extra £200 per night shift for drivers and a £500 bonus for Night Tube staff after accusing London Underground of being \"completely inflexible\" about the terms for the night tube, leaving them \"no other choice\" than to go ahead with the strike.",

Debt climbed 3.8 percent from a year ago to 2.67 billion reais, which is still considered manageable by analysts at 2.4 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA of 225.1 million reais in the first quarter was down almost 1 percent from a year ago.\nThe company said it has set aside financial provisions against a debt of 295.5 million reais it holds with Copersucar, Brazil's biggest sugar trader. Sao Martinho is in the process of unwinding its commercial relationship with Copersucar.\nCost of products sold fell 11 percent from a year ago.\nOn June 30, Sao Martinho had sold 740,000 tonnes of equivalent sugar in nondeliverable forward contracts through March 2016 at an average price of 16.59 U.S. cents/lb as hedge against its expected production this crop.\nDespite a wet start to the harvest season on April 1, which also corresponds with the start of the group's financial year, Sao Martinho crushed 7.4 million tonnes of cane in the first quarter, or 38 percent of its expected crush for the year.\nThe crushing season normally ends around Christmas, which would give Sao Martinho ample time to harvest the crop before the summer rains intensify, but meteorologist expect a strong El Nino to increase the odds of the cane belt turning wetter than normal in the coming months.\n(Reporting by Reese Ewing ; Editing by Ed Davies and Leslie Adler)",

The common currency has been helped by expectations Athens and its international creditors could reach a bailout accord by Tuesday and keep the heavily-indebted country solvent.\n\"Prospects of this specific Greek bailout deal going through are supporting the euro. But these are developments taking place after Greece and its lenders reached a broad agreement last month, and dollar-side factors are likely to determine the direction of the pair in the longer run,\" said Shinichiro Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\nThe dollar has lost a bit of shine following Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which was upbeat but not strong enough to convince the markets that the Federal Reserve could hike interest rates in September, Kadota said.\nThe dollar index treaded water at 97.192 after losing 0.4 percent overnight.\nThe Australian dollar was up 0.1 percent at $0.7419 and in the upper end of the $0.7428-0.7234 range seen over the past three weeks.\nThe Canadian dollar stood little changed at C$1.3013 against the US dollar after gaining 1 percent overnight. The climb lifted it some distance from the 11-year low of C$1.3213 struck last week.\nCopper rebounded from six-year lows overnight, while Brent crude oil rallied 3.7 percent to pull away from 6-1/2 month troughs to give a breather to recently battered commodity currencies.\nThe U.S. currency also stalled against the yen as it sagged against commodity currencies.\nThe dollar was steady at 124.65 yen after being nudged off a high of 124.785 overnight.

The higher than expected surge in U.S. gasoline demand – a closely watched figure that represents 10 percent of the global market – has also helped provide a floor to crashing oil prices. \nU.S. motorists are paying an average of $2.58 per gallon, nearly a dollar less than a year ago, according to AAA, the nation’s largest motorist advocacy group. And a quarter of respondents expected prices to continue to decline, up from 10 percent a month ago. \nThe survey found that nearly 80 percent of people say gas prices influence how they feel about the economy. And with gas prices down nearly $1 from a year ago, U.S. motorists are feeling positive about the direction of the economy, the survey found. \n“There is good news for retailers as consumer optimism picks up during peak vacation season,” said NACS Vice President of Strategic Industry Initiatives Jeff Lenard. \nThe survey found that 34 percent of people expect to drive more during August, compared to 8 percent who said they will drive less. \nThe national average gasoline price per gallon dipped below $2 in January, but most people don’t think the country will see those prices again any time soon. Respondents said if pump prices fall below $2, they would drive even more frequently and have additional discretionary income. \n“The sub $2 would be interesting,” Lenard said. “In previous times, we had big declines that were for terrible events: 2008 economic collapse and 9/11. Those were demand driven. This is supply driven.” \n(Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)",

The higher than expected surge in U.S. gasoline demand – a closely watched figure that represents 10 percent of the global market – has also helped provide a floor to crashing oil prices. \nU.S. motorists are paying an average of $2.58 per gallon, nearly a dollar less than a year ago, according to AAA, the nation’s largest motorist advocacy group. And a quarter of respondents expected prices to continue to decline, up from 10 percent a month ago. \nThe survey found that nearly 80 percent of people say gas prices influence how they feel about the economy. And with gas prices down nearly $1 from a year ago, U.S. motorists are feeling positive about the direction of the economy, the survey found. \n“There is good news for retailers as consumer optimism picks up during peak vacation season,” said NACS Vice President of Strategic Industry Initiatives Jeff Lenard. \nThe survey found that 34 percent of people expect to drive more during August, compared to 8 percent who said they will drive less. \nThe national average gasoline price per gallon dipped below $2 in January, but most people don’t think the country will see those prices again any time soon. Respondents said if pump prices fall below $2, they would drive even more frequently and have additional discretionary income. \n“The sub $2 would be interesting,” Lenard said. “In previous times, we had big declines that were for terrible events: 2008 economic collapse and 9/11. Those were demand driven. This is supply driven.” \n(Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)",

(AP) -- Emergency crews are on the scene of a massive explosion at a southeast Missouri aluminum plant. \nThe explosion and fire around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday sent a large plume of smoke above the Noranda Aluminum plant near the town of Marston in New Madrid County, about 170 miles south of St. Louis. \nNoranda spokesman John Parker says the company has accounted for all employees. He says there were no fatalities or critical injuries. Some people suffered what appeared to be non-critical burns and smoke inhalation. \nParker called the blast a molten metal explosion in the cast house of the plant, which employs about 900 workers. He says 20 people were working in the area when the blast happened. \nThe cause of the explosion is under investigation. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that plant is 170 miles south of St. Louis, instead of 140 miles.",

(AP) -- Emergency crews are on the scene of a massive explosion at a southeast Missouri aluminum plant. \nThe explosion and fire around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday sent a large plume of smoke above the Noranda Aluminum plant near the town of Marston in New Madrid County, about 170 miles south of St. Louis. \nNoranda spokesman John Parker says the company has accounted for all employees. He says there were no fatalities or critical injuries. Some people suffered what appeared to be non-critical burns and smoke inhalation. \nParker called the blast a molten metal explosion in the cast house of the plant, which employs about 900 workers. He says 20 people were working in the area when the blast happened. \nThe cause of the explosion is under investigation. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that plant is 170 miles south of St. Louis, instead of 140 miles.",

This is already the second Tube strike in the space of a month. \nMeanwhile, RMT leaders have claimed the offer \"is just a rehash of an earlier package\" which doesn't address concerns about work/life balance. \nThey believe Underground staff have not been properly consulted about the rota changes that night work would bring, leaving them \"at the beck and call of management to plug staffing gaps\". \nBut Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, has stressed that all workers will still get two days off in every seven, and will have ample opportunity to swap shifts with colleagues if they so wish.",

This is already the second Tube strike in the space of a month. \nMeanwhile, RMT leaders have claimed the offer \"is just a rehash of an earlier package\" which doesn't address concerns about work/life balance. \nThey believe Underground staff have not been properly consulted about the rota changes that night work would bring, leaving them \"at the beck and call of management to plug staffing gaps\". \nBut Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, has stressed that all workers will still get two days off in every seven, and will have ample opportunity to swap shifts with colleagues if they so wish.",
