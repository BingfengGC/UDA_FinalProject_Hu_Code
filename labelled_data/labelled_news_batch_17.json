Two killed as protests over vast mine in Peru turn deadly AFP – 12 minutes ago View Photo \n\nTwo people were killed when protestors worried about possible pollution due to expansion of the massive Las Bambas mine in Peru clashed with police, President Ollanta Humala said. \n\"Sadly, there are two dead. And we are trying to identify them,\" Humala told reporters. \nLas Bambas -- at over 4,000 meters' altitude -- is the largest facility in the country, owned by the Chinese consortium MMG (HKSE: 1208-OL.HK - news ) . It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) bought Glencore XStrata's assets in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2014 for $6 billion. \nResidents of the Apurimac area in southern Peru have asked the government to step in to address the conflict over the new facility. Many locals fear their water supply and crops will be polluted. \nHumala said he would send a Mining and Energy Ministry delegation to the area. \n\"We are not against the Las Bambas mine as a whole. We have worked cooperatively with the mining people,\" said Henry Vasquez, a representative for the demonstrators. \n\"What sparked the protests was that a mineral (residue) treatment plant, and a waste storage facility started to be built and no one had even discussed it with the local people.\" \nMining is one of Peru's economic pillars (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

Two killed as protests over vast mine in Peru turn deadly AFP – 12 minutes ago View Photo \n\nTwo people were killed when protestors worried about possible pollution due to expansion of the massive Las Bambas mine in Peru clashed with police, President Ollanta Humala said. \n\"Sadly, there are two dead. And we are trying to identify them,\" Humala told reporters. \nLas Bambas -- at over 4,000 meters' altitude -- is the largest facility in the country, owned by the Chinese consortium MMG (HKSE: 1208-OL.HK - news ) . It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) bought Glencore XStrata's assets in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2014 for $6 billion. \nResidents of the Apurimac area in southern Peru have asked the government to step in to address the conflict over the new facility. Many locals fear their water supply and crops will be polluted. \nHumala said he would send a Mining and Energy Ministry delegation to the area. \n\"We are not against the Las Bambas mine as a whole. We have worked cooperatively with the mining people,\" said Henry Vasquez, a representative for the demonstrators. \n\"What sparked the protests was that a mineral (residue) treatment plant, and a waste storage facility started to be built and no one had even discussed it with the local people.\" \nMining is one of Peru's economic pillars (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

        "text": "Europe’s market for borrowing and lending securities, including government bonds, barely grew in the 18 months through June 10 with the total value of outstanding repurchase contracts at 5.6 trillion euros ($6.3 trillion), according to the International Capital Market Association.\nTrading in repos -- repurchase agreements where bonds are used as collateral for short-term loans -- acts as the essential plumbing for the wider fixed-income market as it allows traders, particularly those with market-making responsibilities, to obtain securities they need and to finance those they own. The market expanded 2 percent from 5.5 trillion euros in December 2014, the ICMA said. That was about the same as in December 2013, the smallest size since June 2009.\nThe decline of the repo market in recent years has come amid an increase in regulation targeted at shrinking balance sheets at major banks. Borrowing of government debt has been most impacted as Basel III regulations on leverage ratios makes it less profitable to hold sovereign securities considering the relatively low returns and large trade sizes.\n“The stability of the headline figure over the last few surveys does not tell the full story,” said Godfried De Vidts, chairman of the ICMA’s European Repo Council. “The repo market in Europe is not growing in line with underlying conditions.”\nIncreased bond issuance, excess liquidity from central-bank monetary policy operations and increasing demand for collateral driven by regulation means you would have expected more growth, he said. Instead, regulation is beginning “to bite,” De Vidts said.\nMarket Peak The total market peaked at 7 trillion euros in June 2010. This year, the share of government bonds within the pool of European Union-originated collateral reported in the survey declined to 77 percent, from 81.5 percent in December.\nICMA surveyed 65 offices of 61 financial groups for the total value of outstanding repos and reverse repos on June 10. This was two fewer respondents than the December 2014 survey. Using a constant sample of banks to eliminate the effect of changes in the survey sample, it is estimated that the market grew over the previous six months by 4.6 percent but shrank 3.7 percent year-on-year, ICMA said.\nThe survey doesn’t measure repo transactions with central banks as part of official monetary policy operations.",

        "text_full": "European Repo Market Stagnates as Regulation Bites Into Trading\nEurope’s market for borrowing and lending securities, including government bonds, barely grew in the 18 months through June 10 with the total value of outstanding repurchase contracts at 5.6 trillion euros ($6.3 trillion), according to the International Capital Market Association.\nTrading in repos -- repurchase agreements where bonds are used as collateral for short-term loans -- acts as the essential plumbing for the wider fixed-income market as it allows traders, particularly those with market-making responsibilities, to obtain securities they need and to finance those they own. The market expanded 2 percent from 5.5 trillion euros in December 2014, the ICMA said. That was about the same as in December 2013, the smallest size since June 2009.\nThe decline of the repo market in recent years has come amid an increase in regulation targeted at shrinking balance sheets at major banks. Borrowing of government debt has been most impacted as Basel III regulations on leverage ratios makes it less profitable to hold sovereign securities considering the relatively low returns and large trade sizes.\n“The stability of the headline figure over the last few surveys does not tell the full story,” said Godfried De Vidts, chairman of the ICMA’s European Repo Council. “The repo market in Europe is not growing in line with underlying conditions.”\nIncreased bond issuance, excess liquidity from central-bank monetary policy operations and increasing demand for collateral driven by regulation means you would have expected more growth, he said. Instead, regulation is beginning “to bite,” De Vidts said.\nMarket Peak The total market peaked at 7 trillion euros in June 2010. This year, the share of government bonds within the pool of European Union-originated collateral reported in the survey declined to 77 percent, from 81.5 percent in December.\nICMA surveyed 65 offices of 61 financial groups for the total value of outstanding repos and reverse repos on June 10. This was two fewer respondents than the December 2014 survey. Using a constant sample of banks to eliminate the effect of changes in the survey sample, it is estimated that the market grew over the previous six months by 4.6 percent but shrank 3.7 percent year-on-year, ICMA said.\nThe survey doesn’t measure repo transactions with central banks as part of official monetary policy operations.",

Census researchers said both changes were not statistically significant.\nThe Census data are a key indicator of the U.S. economic well-being, and they offer a glimpse into how people were faring five years into recovery from the 2007-2009 recession.\n\"In 2014, real median household income was 6.5 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the most recent recession,\" Census researchers wrote.\nA steady expansion has pushed the U.S. unemployment rate down to near 7-1/2-year lows, but wage gains have lagged and nearly 6.5 million Americans are working part time because they cannot find a full-time job.\nWith the economy regularly a top concern of voters, the findings are likely to add fuel for debate as 16 Republicans and six Democrats jockey for their parties' nominations ahead of the November 2016 presidential election.

Census researchers said both changes were not statistically significant.\nThe Census data are a key indicator of the U.S. economic well-being, and they offer a glimpse into how people were faring five years into recovery from the 2007-2009 recession.\n\"In 2014, real median household income was 6.5 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the most recent recession,\" Census researchers wrote.\nA steady expansion has pushed the U.S. unemployment rate down to near 7-1/2-year lows, but wage gains have lagged and nearly 6.5 million Americans are working part time because they cannot find a full-time job.\nWith the economy regularly a top concern of voters, the findings are likely to add fuel for debate as 16 Republicans and six Democrats jockey for their parties' nominations ahead of the November 2016 presidential election.

Either way, you're going to hear a lot more about the world's emerging economic powerhouse in the coming days. \nGeorge Osborne is in Beijing for his biggest trade visit to the country yet. \nHe has taken with him a host of financiers, chief executives, some cultural leaders and even one or two journalists. \nWe touched down in China's capital this morning to begin a week-long journey across the country, from Beijing and Shanghai in the east to Chengdu, Urumqi and its far west reaches. \nIt is all intended to set up what the Chancellor calls \"a golden decade of UK-China relations\". \nThere will be announcements about cultural exchanges and exhibits, new investment projects and financial deals. \nWhy all the noise? It’s all part of the Government’s attempts to try to boost its trade with China. \nFor despite the fact that China’s contribution to world GDP has risen from under 2% in 1990 to almost 15% last year, it still only accounts for 3.6% of the UK’s exports. \nThat makes it Britain's sixth-biggest goods export market, somewhere beneath Belgium. \nThe Chancellor is determined to push China higher. \nAnd walking around Beijing you can understand why. \nThis is a thriving metropolis full of increasingly wealthy consumers who are now finally starting to spend. \nThe Chancellor's hope is that they spend this money on British luxury goods. \nHowever, he is faced with a number of problems. \nOne is that Chinese firms are competing desperately with British ones for business on their own soil. \nAnother is that China has its own problems. \nIts stock market crash last month was a sign that the country’s economic bubble may be starting to burst. \nThere are some who fear its breakneck growth, fuelled largely by borrowing, could end in an almighty slump. \nThose jitters have not stopped the Chancellor’s long-planned visit. \nBut they are likely to come up repeatedly as he meets with Chinese leaders and businesspeople.",

Brendan McAtamney, the current chief operating officer, will be his succesor. \n“It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has been my privilege to lead this company for 15 exciting years,” added Mr Fitzgerald. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in UDG Healthcare (LSE: UDG.L - news ) jumped 33p higher, or 8pc, to 526p in early trading.",

Learn more... \nFri, Sep 18, 2015, 11:58 BST - UK Markets close in 4 hrs 32 mins UDG Healthcare sells off £300m drugs business By John Ficenec | Telegraph – 12 minutes ago +30.0000 \nThe Dublin-based healthcare and pharmaceutical consultancy sells its distribution arm to US group McKesson \nUDG Healthcare , a provider of medical equipment and healthcare services, is to sell its drug distribution businesses for €408m (£300m). \nThe Dublin-based group announced the proposed sale of its United Drug Supply and MASTA travel business to McKesson, one of the largest US-based pharmaceutical distribution companies in the Fortune 500. \nThe FTSE 250-listed company will receive €407.5m in cash for the combined businesses, which generated revenues of €1.4bn and adjusted earnings of €30.3m in the year to September 2014. \nThe funds will be used to repay €142m in bank debt and further the expansion of its healthcare consultancy business. \nJames Vane-Tempest, analyst from broker Jefferies, said: \"The disposal not only allows the businesses to prosper under the ownership of McKesson but also accelerates UDG’s transformation to a more focused international healthcare services business whilst significantly improving its growth potential and margin profile.\" \nUDG has been moving away from its drugs distribution business to focus on providing marketing and sales consulting through its Ashfield division, and packaging through its Sharp division. \nThe company completed an €82m sale of its half-share in a drug distribution business to its partner Alliance Boots last year. \nAlongside the deal, Liam Fitzgerald, chief executive, announced that he planned to retire at the end of March. Brendan McAtamney, the current chief operating officer, will be his succesor. \n“It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has been my privilege to lead this company for 15 exciting years,” added Mr Fitzgerald. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in UDG Healthcare (LSE: UDG.L - news ) jumped 33p higher, or 8pc, to 526p in early trading.",

It's declining growth,\" Lousberg said.\nThe current supply glut would lead to half of Chinese construction equipment producers to close, Lousberg added.\nThey number \"in the thousands\", with some making just a few products, he said.\nHe expects the market to recover around 2017 to 2018 due to massive infrastructure construction by China at home and overseas.\nTerex, which competes with Caterpillar, operates a crane manufacturing venture in Xiamen. The Westport, CT-based firm registered compound annual growth in sales over the past five years in China by focusing on segments that are still growing, said Lousberg.\nThat includes equipment used for rock cutting, he added.\nIn August, Terex and Finnish rival Konecranes agreed to an all-share merger, with a combined $10 billion in annual revenues.

It's declining growth,\" Lousberg said.\nThe current supply glut would lead to half of Chinese construction equipment producers to close, Lousberg added.\nThey number \"in the thousands\", with some making just a few products, he said.\nHe expects the market to recover around 2017 to 2018 due to massive infrastructure construction by China at home and overseas.\nTerex, which competes with Caterpillar, operates a crane manufacturing venture in Xiamen. The Westport, CT-based firm registered compound annual growth in sales over the past five years in China by focusing on segments that are still growing, said Lousberg.\nThat includes equipment used for rock cutting, he added.\nIn August, Terex and Finnish rival Konecranes agreed to an all-share merger, with a combined $10 billion in annual revenues.

The suspension was seen as a diplomatic victory for the Obama administration, coming shortly after visits to Beijing by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. \nIn July, China's legislature adopted a sweeping national security law that said all key network infrastructure and information systems must be \"secure and controllable\". \n(Reporting by Kazunori Takada and Adam Jourdan; Editing by Paul Tait and Richard Pullin)",

You can open the account online and withdrawing cash early will result in the loss of 90 days’ interest on the money. \n• Predictions on rates, stock markets and much more: get our weekly newsletter \nVirgin Money’s two-year cash Isa pays 2.06pc, an improvement on the previous best-buy from Halifax that pays 2pc. \nVirgin also launched an accompanying two-year savings bond, for money outside an Isa, that pays 2.06pc but the rate is some way off the best-buy in that category 2.35pc offered by RCI Bank, Aldermore and Kent Reliance. \nCompeition among savings providers is heating up. Another challenger to the high street giants, RCI Bank, this week launched a three-year bond paying 2.7pc - beating the current best deal by a larger margin than is usual. \nTom Adams, head of research at savings adviser Savingschampion.co.uk, said: “Just as we were thinking that the recent flurry of new best buy fixed rate ISAs was starting to subside, in swooped two of the most active providers in this category in recent times with a couple of market leading accounts. \n“What is particularly pleasing about these changes is that both providers were already well placed in the best buy tables, with Virgin joint top and Shawbrook in joint second place and they were not content with this, wanting to stand out from the pack. \n\"Long may this type of move continue, as it is pushing rates back in the right direction and hopefully other providers will follow suit.” \n• Reader service: Open an ISA, SIPP or trading account with Telegraph Investor",

The coding change introduced an error into Latour's software.\nTrading firms are required to have direct and exclusive control of their financial and regulatory risk management controls.\nLatour agreed to pay a $5 million penalty, disgorgement of $2.8 million of gross trading profits and exchange-paid rebates, plus prejudgment interest of $268,564, without admitting or denying the charges.

The Conservatives hold just five Quebec seats.\nThe minority separatist Bloc Quebecois party of Gilles Duceppe - trying to revive its fortunes after being crushed in the last election in 2011 - support Harper's idea.\nBoth main opposition parties say the ban violates the rights of Canadians and accuse the Conservatives of fueling prejudice.\n\"Mr. Harper and Mr. Duceppe want to play on fear and division,\" Liberal leader Justin Trudeau said during a French-language debate in Montreal, Quebec's biggest city.\n\"If a man can't dictate how a woman should dress, we can't have the state telling a woman how she shouldn't dress,\" he said.\nThomas Mulcair of the New Democrats said Harper was trying to hide his poor economic record behind a veil.\n\"Mr. Mulcair, never, I will never say to my daughter that a woman must cover herself up because she is a woman,\" Harper shot back angrily.\nThe government is taking its case for the ban to the Supreme Court after twice losing in lower courts.\nThe New Democrats unexpectedly swept most of Quebec in the 2011 election as the Bloc collapsed. The party has little chance of winning power federally for the first time unless it can hang onto its gains.\nAfter Quebec came close to voting for secession in 1995, the then-Liberal federal government pushed through a law saying Ottawa would only allow a province to secede if a large majority of the population voted in favor.\nMulcair says a simple majority should be enough and this could open him up accusations that he would make it easier to break up Canada if he took power.

The system will allow large international companies doing business with China to settle payments faster. \nAmong the first batch of banks qualified to participate are 11 Chinese banks and eight Chinese branches of foreign banks, including HSBC, Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) and Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) PLC, the sources said. \nThe launch of CIPS will remove one of the biggest hurdles to internationalising the yuan, and should greatly increase global use of the currency by cutting transaction costs and processing times. \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters. \n(Reporting by Zhao Hongmei and Nick Heath; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)",

The system will allow large international companies doing business with China to settle payments faster. \nAmong the first batch of banks qualified to participate are 11 Chinese banks and eight Chinese branches of foreign banks, including HSBC, Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) and Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) PLC, the sources said. \nThe launch of CIPS will remove one of the biggest hurdles to internationalising the yuan, and should greatly increase global use of the currency by cutting transaction costs and processing times. \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters. \n(Reporting by Zhao Hongmei and Nick Heath; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)",

He said companies tend to charge their foreign subsidiaries low licensing fees as a way to shift reportable income away from the US, where corporate tax rates are higher. \nTypically, Mr Willens said, the cases are settled for a fraction of the amount of the assessment. \n“They hardly ever get to court, because neither party wants to experience the hazards of litigation,” he added. \nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coca-Cola said it has been following the same methodology for determining its taxable US income for nearly 30 years. \n“The IRS now seeks to depart from this long-standing practice in order to increase substantially the amount of tax,” the company said. “We are among hundreds of other companies currently facing these types of adjustments involving payments.” \nCoca-Cola said it was notified that a recommendation was made to the IRS’s chief counsel that the matter be designated for litigation. The company said it plans to start disputing the matter by filing a petition in US Tax Court. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the IRS made the determination on owed taxes after a five-year audit.",

He said companies tend to charge their foreign subsidiaries low licensing fees as a way to shift reportable income away from the US, where corporate tax rates are higher. \nTypically, Mr Willens said, the cases are settled for a fraction of the amount of the assessment. \n“They hardly ever get to court, because neither party wants to experience the hazards of litigation,” he added. \nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coca-Cola said it has been following the same methodology for determining its taxable US income for nearly 30 years. \n“The IRS now seeks to depart from this long-standing practice in order to increase substantially the amount of tax,” the company said. “We are among hundreds of other companies currently facing these types of adjustments involving payments.” \nCoca-Cola said it was notified that a recommendation was made to the IRS’s chief counsel that the matter be designated for litigation. The company said it plans to start disputing the matter by filing a petition in US Tax Court. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the IRS made the determination on owed taxes after a five-year audit.",

The fastest service costs £30 per month plus line rental on Sky, or £21.70 on TalkTalk. \nThe York network is also around three times faster than the “G.fast” upgrade BT pledged to invest in for 10m homes over the next five years if regulators and the Government resist calls to break it up. \nLyssa McGowan, director of Sky Broadband, said: “Sky is the first broadband service provider in the UK to offer guaranteed broadband speeds.

Thirty-year bonds gained 26/32 in price to \nyield 2.95 percent, down from 2.99 percent. \nThe yield curve also flattened as investors prepared for a \npossible rate increase. The gap (NYSE: GPS - news ) between five-year note and \n30-year bond yields flattened to 142 basis points \nfrom 144 basis points on Thursday. \n\"Investors are trying to get into flattening trades because \ntheir perception is that if the Fed doesn't tighten next week \nthey will tighten sometime this year,\" said di Galoma. \nThe completion of heavy new issuance of Treasury and \ncorporate debt also helped bonds rally, although a number of \ncompanies are still expected to sell new debt on Friday. \nThe government sold $58 billion in new coupon-bearing supply \nthis week, while investment-grade companies have sold more than \n$50 billion in high-grade debt so far this week. \nData on Friday showed that U.S. producer prices were flat in \nAugust, pointing to benign inflation pressures that could weigh \non the Federal Reserve's decision whether to hike interest rates \nnext week.",

The gap (NYSE: GPS - news ) between five-year note and \n30-year bond yields flattened to 142 basis points \nfrom 144 basis points on Thursday. \n\"Investors are trying to get into flattening trades because \ntheir perception is that if the Fed doesn't tighten next week \nthey will tighten sometime this year,\" said di Galoma. \nThe completion of heavy new issuance of Treasury and \ncorporate debt also helped bonds rally, although a number of \ncompanies are still expected to sell new debt on Friday. \nThe government sold $58 billion in new coupon-bearing supply \nthis week, while investment-grade companies have sold more than \n$50 billion in high-grade debt so far this week. \nData on Friday showed that U.S. producer prices were flat in \nAugust, pointing to benign inflation pressures that could weigh \non the Federal Reserve's decision whether to hike interest rates \nnext week.",

They had closed down 1.5 percent at $36.44.\nDelayed fertilizer purchases in Brazil and North America have weakened markets, along with volatile currency and equity markets and lower crop prices, Mosaic said in a statement after markets closed.\nAs a result, the Minnesota-based company said it would extend maintenance downtime at its Colonsay, Saskatchewan potash mine in Western Canada.\n\"We are managing our production levels to match current demand, controlling our costs, and maintaining our discipline,\" said Chief Executive Joc O'Rourke, who took over in August.\nMosaic, North America's second-biggest potash producer, said potash volumes for the third quarter are expected to be in the bottom half of its guidance range of 1.6 million to 2 million tonnes. The average selling price for muriate of potash is expected to be in the bottom half of the previously announced range of $260 to $280 per tonne.\nThe world's largest producer of finished phosphate products said phosphate volumes are expected to be at the low end of its range of 2.1 to 2.4 million tonnes for the third quarter.

They had closed down 1.5 percent at $36.44.\nDelayed fertilizer purchases in Brazil and North America have weakened markets, along with volatile currency and equity markets and lower crop prices, Mosaic said in a statement after markets closed.\nAs a result, the Minnesota-based company said it would extend maintenance downtime at its Colonsay, Saskatchewan potash mine in Western Canada.\n\"We are managing our production levels to match current demand, controlling our costs, and maintaining our discipline,\" said Chief Executive Joc O'Rourke, who took over in August.\nMosaic, North America's second-biggest potash producer, said potash volumes for the third quarter are expected to be in the bottom half of its guidance range of 1.6 million to 2 million tonnes. The average selling price for muriate of potash is expected to be in the bottom half of the previously announced range of $260 to $280 per tonne.\nThe world's largest producer of finished phosphate products said phosphate volumes are expected to be at the low end of its range of 2.1 to 2.4 million tonnes for the third quarter.

The market seems to have shrugged off the weak Chinese trade data and is now looking beyond that for cues,\" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at IG Markets in Sydney, told AFP. \n\"We might see some movement ... depending on how the US stockpile numbers turn out,\" he said. \nChina said Tuesday its exports fell 5.5 percent year-on-year in August while imports plunged 13.8 percent, led by falling commodity prices, adding to worries about the strength of the world's number two economy and top energy consumer. \nThe slowdown in Chinese growth, as well as a slew of other weak indicators, have sent panic through world markets, as the country is a key driver of global expansion. \nIn the United States, the Department of Energy will release its weekly petroleum report on Thursday, a day later than usual owing to the Labor Day holiday on Monday. \nUS crude reserves likely rose by 250,000 barrels in the week to September 4, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. An increase in stockpiles usually points towards weaker demand. \nDealers had been hoping that an uptick in US demand, coupled with a slowdown in output, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason for the collapse in prices from around $120 in June last year.",

Learn more... \nWed, Sep 9, 2015, 13:09 BST - UK Markets close in 3 hrs 21 mins Oil prices drift lower View Photo \n\nOil edged lower Wednesday in muted deals as dealers digested poor Chinese trade data and looked ahead to the weekly US stockpiles report, analysts said. \nBrent North Sea crude for October slid six cents to $49.46 per barrel in London late morning deals. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in October fell 22 cents to $45.72 a barrel. \nWTI prices had also dipped on Tuesday in subdued trade following Monday's closure of the New York Mercantile Exchange for the Labor Day holiday. \n\"We are seeing trading volumes for oil futures down a third than on average. The market seems to have shrugged off the weak Chinese trade data and is now looking beyond that for cues,\" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at IG Markets in Sydney, told AFP. \n\"We might see some movement ... depending on how the US stockpile numbers turn out,\" he said. \nChina said Tuesday its exports fell 5.5 percent year-on-year in August while imports plunged 13.8 percent, led by falling commodity prices, adding to worries about the strength of the world's number two economy and top energy consumer. \nThe slowdown in Chinese growth, as well as a slew of other weak indicators, have sent panic through world markets, as the country is a key driver of global expansion. \nIn the United States, the Department of Energy will release its weekly petroleum report on Thursday, a day later than usual owing to the Labor Day holiday on Monday. \nUS crude reserves likely rose by 250,000 barrels in the week to September 4, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. An increase in stockpiles usually points towards weaker demand. \nDealers had been hoping that an uptick in US demand, coupled with a slowdown in output, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason for the collapse in prices from around $120 in June last year.",

Tokyo markets will be closed for much of next week, reopening on Thursday.\nU.S. Treasury prices rose and yields skidded on Thursday, with two-year yields declining the most in a day in six and a half years.\nDespite some encouraging domestic signs, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the external outlook was less certain. The U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged, but left open the possibility of a modest policy tightening later this year.\n($1 = 119.6900 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",

Tokyo markets will be closed for much of next week, reopening on Thursday.\nU.S. Treasury prices rose and yields skidded on Thursday, with two-year yields declining the most in a day in six and a half years.\nDespite some encouraging domestic signs, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the external outlook was less certain. The U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged, but left open the possibility of a modest policy tightening later this year.\n($1 = 119.6900 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",

Baker and Greg Roumeliotis \n(Reuters) - Solera Holdings Inc, the insurance claims processing software maker that has sought to sell itself in a leveraged buyout, has so far failed to agree on an acquisition price with private equity firms, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. \nBuyout firms Vista Equity Partners and Thoma Bravo LLC have made offers that failed to meet Solera's valuation expectations, the people said. \nSolera is now trying to sell itself to another company rather than an investment firm, the people said. Among the companies Solera has reached out to solicit interest is IHS Inc, an information services company based in Englewood, Colorado, the people added. \nIHS declined to comment. \nWestlake, Texas-based Solera did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThoma Bravo is trying to improve on its offer by increasing the amount of money it is seeking to borrow from banks for the deal, some of the people said. It is not clear if banks will provide Thoma Bravo with the financing it needs. \nThe sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. \nThoma Bravo and Vista Equity both declined to comment. \nSolera, founded in 2005, has a market capitalization of $3.22 billion. \nOn Aug. 20 Solera said it was exploring a \"variety of strategic alternatives.\" The company hired Rothschild as its financial adviser while its board of directors' special committee hired adviser Centerview Partners LLC and the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. \nAccording to Solera's website, the company's clients include the 10 largest insurance companies in Europe and the United States. \nPrivate equity firms have been active acquirers of insurance services providers, attracted by their resilience in financial downturns \n(Reporting by Liana B.

Baker and Greg Roumeliotis \n(Reuters) - Solera Holdings Inc, the insurance claims processing software maker that has sought to sell itself in a leveraged buyout, has so far failed to agree on an acquisition price with private equity firms, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. \nBuyout firms Vista Equity Partners and Thoma Bravo LLC have made offers that failed to meet Solera's valuation expectations, the people said. \nSolera is now trying to sell itself to another company rather than an investment firm, the people said. Among the companies Solera has reached out to solicit interest is IHS Inc, an information services company based in Englewood, Colorado, the people added. \nIHS declined to comment. \nWestlake, Texas-based Solera did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThoma Bravo is trying to improve on its offer by increasing the amount of money it is seeking to borrow from banks for the deal, some of the people said. It is not clear if banks will provide Thoma Bravo with the financing it needs. \nThe sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. \nThoma Bravo and Vista Equity both declined to comment. \nSolera, founded in 2005, has a market capitalization of $3.22 billion. \nOn Aug. 20 Solera said it was exploring a \"variety of strategic alternatives.\" The company hired Rothschild as its financial adviser while its board of directors' special committee hired adviser Centerview Partners LLC and the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. \nAccording to Solera's website, the company's clients include the 10 largest insurance companies in Europe and the United States. \nPrivate equity firms have been active acquirers of insurance services providers, attracted by their resilience in financial downturns \n(Reporting by Liana B.

His predecessor, Reto Francioni, set the course firmly for expansion in Asia as crucial to the exchange operator's success in the coming years. \nWhile Kengeter, who has worked in Asia and speaks some Chinese, is still committed to the region, his most significant moves so far have been in Europe, with the takeover of foreign exchange trading platform 360T and buyouts of equity index joint ventures Stoxx and Indexium from Switzerland's Six Group. \nA Deutsche Boerse spokesman broadly confirmed the delay to Eurex Asia to 2017 due to \"internal and external\" reasons but declined to give details. \n\"The scope and objective of the project remain unchanged; the significant expansion of the Asia business is an important element of our corporate strategy,\" the spokesman said. \nBeside its plans for Eurex Asia, Deutsche Boerse announced earlier this year that it had agreed to set up a joint venture with Shanghai Stock Exchange and China Financial Future Exchange to develop and market Chinese shares, bonds and ETFs for investors outside mainland China. \n(Reporting by Andreas Kroener; Writing by Jonathan Gould; Editing by Thomas Atkins; Editing by Thomas Atkins)",

We foresee this growing to more than 200 in five years,\" Taste said.\nTaste, which also operates Domino's Pizza outlets in South Africa, said it would start with at least 12 outlets in the next year before expanding further.\nGlobal restaurant brands are increasingly investing in Africa to join established international players such as McDonald's Corp in tapping a growing middle class.\nStarbucks' entry into South Africa will pit it against established brands such as unlisted Cape Town-based Vida e Caffè, a local firm with more than 60 outlets.

African cafes in five years\nJOHANNESBURG, Sept 23 Starbucks' local partner sees potential for more than 200 of the U.S. chain's coffee shops in South Africa within five years, it said on Wednesday, as it prepares to open the country's first Starbucks' outlet next year.\nStarbucks signed an agreement with Taste Holdings in July that licensed the South African restaurant operator to develop and run Starbucks-branded coffee shops in Africa's most advanced economy.\nThe first store is expected in Gauteng province, the region that includes Johannesburg, within the first half of 2016, Taste said in a statement.\n\"Market analysis has identified a conservative market opportunity of more than 150 outlets in South Africa today. We foresee this growing to more than 200 in five years,\" Taste said.\nTaste, which also operates Domino's Pizza outlets in South Africa, said it would start with at least 12 outlets in the next year before expanding further.\nGlobal restaurant brands are increasingly investing in Africa to join established international players such as McDonald's Corp in tapping a growing middle class.\nStarbucks' entry into South Africa will pit it against established brands such as unlisted Cape Town-based Vida e Caffè, a local firm with more than 60 outlets.

France lost its top-flight Aaa rating in November 2012 as the eurozone sank into crisis, and the new rating is two steps below that. \nMoody's said that overall France's credit-worthiness \"remains extremely high\" and gave the new rating a \"stable\" outlook. \nSupporting that is \"the country's efforts to stabilize its public sector finances and initiatives recently deployed or announced to arrest the erosion of the economy's competitiveness (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"",

France lost its top-flight Aaa rating in November 2012 as the eurozone sank into crisis, and the new rating is two steps below that. \nMoody's said that overall France's credit-worthiness \"remains extremely high\" and gave the new rating a \"stable\" outlook. \nSupporting that is \"the country's efforts to stabilize its public sector finances and initiatives recently deployed or announced to arrest the erosion of the economy's competitiveness (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"",

Ikea furnishes 11% sales jump AFP – 7 minutes ago View Photo \n\nIkea, the world's top furniture company, said Thursday its sales jumped 11.2 percent during its 2014-2015 fiscal year, thanks to gains in nearly all markets but particularly in China and Germany. \nThe Ikea Group, the Dutch holding company which controls the Swedish brand's 328 stores in 28 countries, said sales totalled 31.9 billion euros ($35.7 billion). \nChina was the company's fastest growing market followed by Russia, with most of the sales growth, 5.1 percent, coming from existing stores. \nAdjusted for currency fluctuations, sales rose by 8.9 percent. \n\"We are continuing to grow strongly in China thanks to the middle class which is showing more and more interest in home comfort,\" chief executive Peter Agnefjaell told AFP. \nIkea opened three new stores in China during its 2014-2015 fiscal year. \nMeanwhile Ikea said it registered record growth in Germany and North America performed well. \nStill absent from Africa and South America, the specialist in flat-pack furniture that budget-minded consumers can assemble themselves, opened 13 new stores and welcomed 770 million visitors. \n\"Looking ahead, we see many opportunities for us to continue to grow through our stores...\", Agnefjaell said in a company statement. \nHe declined to confirm on information in the media that the group aims to create 100,000 new jobs by 2020. \n\"We are pursuing a growth strategy and we'll need to recruit in the years to come,\" he told AFP. \nWhile Asia was a priority, he said Ikea's management had always put emphasis on getting things right before studying opportunities for further development. \nDespite the Dutch-registered company, Ikea is still managed from the town of Aelmhult in southern Sweden, where it was founded in 1943 by Ingvar Kamprad. \nKamprad, whose fortune is estimated at more than 30 billion euros, still has a hand in running the company, and three children are part of the management. \nAs it is family-owned, Ikea is required to publish only limited information about its results. The company's annual report will be published in December.",

Ikea furnishes 11% sales jump AFP – 7 minutes ago View Photo \n\nIkea, the world's top furniture company, said Thursday its sales jumped 11.2 percent during its 2014-2015 fiscal year, thanks to gains in nearly all markets but particularly in China and Germany. \nThe Ikea Group, the Dutch holding company which controls the Swedish brand's 328 stores in 28 countries, said sales totalled 31.9 billion euros ($35.7 billion). \nChina was the company's fastest growing market followed by Russia, with most of the sales growth, 5.1 percent, coming from existing stores. \nAdjusted for currency fluctuations, sales rose by 8.9 percent. \n\"We are continuing to grow strongly in China thanks to the middle class which is showing more and more interest in home comfort,\" chief executive Peter Agnefjaell told AFP. \nIkea opened three new stores in China during its 2014-2015 fiscal year. \nMeanwhile Ikea said it registered record growth in Germany and North America performed well. \nStill absent from Africa and South America, the specialist in flat-pack furniture that budget-minded consumers can assemble themselves, opened 13 new stores and welcomed 770 million visitors. \n\"Looking ahead, we see many opportunities for us to continue to grow through our stores...\", Agnefjaell said in a company statement. \nHe declined to confirm on information in the media that the group aims to create 100,000 new jobs by 2020. \n\"We are pursuing a growth strategy and we'll need to recruit in the years to come,\" he told AFP. \nWhile Asia was a priority, he said Ikea's management had always put emphasis on getting things right before studying opportunities for further development. \nDespite the Dutch-registered company, Ikea is still managed from the town of Aelmhult in southern Sweden, where it was founded in 1943 by Ingvar Kamprad. \nKamprad, whose fortune is estimated at more than 30 billion euros, still has a hand in running the company, and three children are part of the management. \nAs it is family-owned, Ikea is required to publish only limited information about its results. The company's annual report will be published in December.",

A Glencore spokesman declined to confirm Thursday's meeting. \nThe London-listed company said on Monday it planned to suspend 400,000 tonnes of copper output at Katanga and at Mopani Copper Mines in Zambia over the next 18 months. \n\"This is not a mine that is going to close. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's just a moment when the copper price is very, very low,\" said the adviser, referring to Katanga Mining (Toronto: KAT.TO - news ) . \"When they sell copper they lose money.\" \nHe said Glencore's Mutanda Mining operation in Congo was a more efficient operation and did not face the same problems. \nA Glencore source said the company would invest about $900 million in Katanga Mining to modernize it. This would bring the production cost per pound down from $2.50 to about $1.65 by time mine reopens in 2017. \nBy comparison, Mutanda Mining's cost of production is around $1.33 per pound of copper because it is a newer mine, the source said. \nThe source declined to comment on potential job losses, saying discussions about employment continued. \n(Reporting by Aaron Ross; Writing by Daniel Flynn; editing by Susan Thomas)",

A Glencore spokesman declined to confirm Thursday's meeting. \nThe London-listed company said on Monday it planned to suspend 400,000 tonnes of copper output at Katanga and at Mopani Copper Mines in Zambia over the next 18 months. \n\"This is not a mine that is going to close. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's just a moment when the copper price is very, very low,\" said the adviser, referring to Katanga Mining (Toronto: KAT.TO - news ) . \"When they sell copper they lose money.\" \nHe said Glencore's Mutanda Mining operation in Congo was a more efficient operation and did not face the same problems. \nA Glencore source said the company would invest about $900 million in Katanga Mining to modernize it. This would bring the production cost per pound down from $2.50 to about $1.65 by time mine reopens in 2017. \nBy comparison, Mutanda Mining's cost of production is around $1.33 per pound of copper because it is a newer mine, the source said. \nThe source declined to comment on potential job losses, saying discussions about employment continued. \n(Reporting by Aaron Ross; Writing by Daniel Flynn; editing by Susan Thomas)",

It expects to originate more than $500 million in loans by the end of the year.\nCommonBond secured $150 million in loan purchase commitments in February from student loan servicing company Nelnet to finance more loans.\nIn July, the company hired former Macquarie Capital banker Morgan Edwards as its chief financial officer.\nDue to regulatory scrutiny, many large banks have pulled back from the student loan market, which topped nearly $1.3 trillion at the end of the second quarter. CommonBond competes with Social Finance Inc or SoFi for student loan refinancing business. CommonBond says it saves borrowers more than $14,000 on average over the life of the loan.

But he added Tuesday that waters were not contaminated and would not be harmful to humans. \nOn Sept. 13, Barrick said a pipe carrying cyanide at the Veladero mine had a valve failure causing a leak into nearby waters. An investigation determined about 35,300 cubic feet (1,000 cubic meters) of liquid cyanide spilled. \nLocal residents have feared contamination of their water resources. \nBarrick has declined to comment on the judicial decisions.

But he added Tuesday that waters were not contaminated and would not be harmful to humans. \nOn Sept. 13, Barrick said a pipe carrying cyanide at the Veladero mine had a valve failure causing a leak into nearby waters. An investigation determined about 35,300 cubic feet (1,000 cubic meters) of liquid cyanide spilled. \nLocal residents have feared contamination of their water resources. \nBarrick has declined to comment on the judicial decisions.
