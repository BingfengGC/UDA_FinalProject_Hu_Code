U.S. companies make up 52 percent.\nBank of America is considering removing emerging-market companies from sub-indexes such as the euro high-yield index, even if it keeps them in the global benchmark.\n“It can be tricky when you have an index that suddenly has a big weight from countries like Brazil and Russia,” said Roman Gaiser, who oversees 3.5 billion euros of assets as the Geneva-based head of high yield at Pictet Asset Management SA. “In those countries, the sovereign risk overwhelmingly dominates the corporate risk.”",

We understand that the acquisition is subject to numerous regulatory and shareholder approvals,\" the rating agency said on Tuesday. \nHowever, the company's long-term and short-term ratings, which have been under CreditWatch since April, are removed. \nAlso, the rating on the company could be lowered further if the BG acquisition is finalized and further effects credit metrics of the company, S&P said in the note. \nThe rating agency now anticipates a lower ratio of funds from operations to debt over 2015 to 2017 and assess the company's financial risk profile as \"intermediate\" instead of \"modest.\" \n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru)",

We understand that the acquisition is subject to numerous regulatory and shareholder approvals,\" the rating agency said on Tuesday. \nHowever, the company's long-term and short-term ratings, which have been under CreditWatch since April, are removed. \nAlso, the rating on the company could be lowered further if the BG acquisition is finalized and further effects credit metrics of the company, S&P said in the note. \nThe rating agency now anticipates a lower ratio of funds from operations to debt over 2015 to 2017 and assess the company's financial risk profile as \"intermediate\" instead of \"modest.\" \n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru)",

Credit managers for the manufacturers who are owed the money are reporting that more of their clients are so far behind in their bills that the \"act of last resort\" is being taken: hiring a collection agency to recoup money owed, said Chris Kuehl, economic adviser for the National Association of Credit Management .\nThe association conducts a monthly survey of about 1,700 credit managers whose companies&apos; customers include automotive and energy businesses, mostly with fewer than 500 employees.

When planning for this year, many of these companies expected the price of oil to rebound, he said. This \"unjustified optimism\" has left many of these companies in bad shape, Kuehl said.\nThere may be more strain ahead.

Hayes said he felt compelled to exaggerate his role in order to be charged in the U.K. and avoid extradition to the U.S.\n“I’m trying to give the answer I needed to give,” Hayes said with his wife and family looking on from the public gallery in a London courtroom.

Each count carries as much as 10 years in prison.\nProsecutors say Hayes bullied and cajoled fellow traders and brokers to move benchmark rates to make his positions more profitable. Hayes’s lawyers say the practice was widespread.",

Hayes said he felt compelled to exaggerate his role in order to be charged in the U.K. and avoid extradition to the U.S.\n“I’m trying to give the answer I needed to give,” Hayes said with his wife and family looking on from the public gallery in a London courtroom. I wanted to say “I don’t think I’ve done anything” wrong.\nThe 35-year-old Hayes has been testifying this week at his trial where he has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of conspiracy to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, the benchmark used to value more than $350 trillion of loans and securities. Each count carries as much as 10 years in prison.\nProsecutors say Hayes bullied and cajoled fellow traders and brokers to move benchmark rates to make his positions more profitable. Hayes’s lawyers say the practice was widespread.",

        "text": "Telecommunications tycoon Patrick Drahi boosted earnings at his holding company and French carrier Numericable-SFR SAS through cost cuts and a focus on more lucrative customers buying high-speed services.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at Numericable-SFR rose 19 percent to 1.06 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in the second quarter, the company said Wednesday. Altice SA, the holding company, boosted Ebitda 13 percent.\nBillionaire Drahi took over SFR about eight months ago and merged it with his Numericable to add wireless services. With competition pushing phone bills lower in France, Drahi this year sought to take over rival Bouygues Telecom but was rebuffed by owner Bouygues SA. Now Numericable-SFR is offering the latest high-speed network technology in a bid to charge more amid competition from Orange SA and discounter Iliad SA.\nShares of Numericable-SFR advanced 6.9 percent to 52.72 euros at 9:09 a.m. in Paris, giving the company a market value of 23.1 billion euros. Altice added 4.6 percent to 119.90 euros in Amsterdam for a value of 29.7 billion euros.\nNumericable-SFR’s net income was 79 million euros after a loss a year earlier. Revenue fell 2.4 percent to 2.8 billion euros as the company lost customers.\nExpanding Empire Through Altice, Drahi has been buying telecommunications assets from Portugal to the U.S. in a bet he can revamp their business and seek synergies to increase earnings. The Numericable-SFR parent reported a 2 percent decline in second-quarter sales to 3.9 billion euros, while Ebitda was 1.5 billion euros. Altice also owns operations in Israel and the Dominican Republic.\nIn France, Numericable-SFR had 12.5 million mobile subscribers at the end of the second quarter, down from 12.9 million in the end of the previous quarter. The number of fixed-line customers fell to 6.4 million from 6.5 million.\nLarger rival Orange Tuesday reported sales and earnings exceeding analysts’ estimates as broadband revenue rose and wireless sales dropped at a slower pace.",

But with Brent still trading around $47 a barrel, vs. the more than $100 it fetched more than a year ago, companies are finally idling deepwater drill ships.\nThe number of idle drill ships has more than tripled since the beginning of last year, to 31, or about one in every four such vessels at sea around the globe, according to data from Bloomberg. About a third of those unused ships are in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.

You can see the breakdown in the following chart.\nMacquarie&apos;s latest forecast for oil prices could mean more bad news for offshore drillers.

But the government official said the composition of the coalition was not expected to change.\n(Reporting by Renee Maltezou; writing by Matthias Williams )",

Last Monday, after Greek voters rejected austerity measures in a referendum, Japanese policymakers met and pledged to work closely to guard against financial market volatility.

Diesel drivers ‘overcharged by £250m’ in past month By Andrew Critchlow | Telegraph – 22 minutes ago Print \nRAC Foundation accuses retailers of not passing on wholesale savings in diesel to motorists \nDrivers of diesel cars have been overcharged by as much as £250m in recent weeks because retailers have not passed on wholesale fuel savings, it can be revealed. \nAccording to an analysis by the RAC Foundation, the price of diesel at the refinery gate fell six weeks ago below that of petrol and has been about 2p per litre lower ever since. \nHowever, on the forecourts diesel has been around 4p a litre more expensive over the same period. While the retail margin on petrol at the start of July was 1.8p per litre, it was 10.2p per litre for diesel. \nThe RAC Foundation estimates that motorists would have saved £250m if diesel had been priced at the same rate as petrol over the period. \nSteve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: “While it can take a couple of weeks for shifts in the wholesale price of fuel to feed through to the forecourts, it is now six weeks since the cost of petrol at the refinery gate overtook that of diesel. If ever there was a case of sticky prices, this looks like it.” \nIt is estimated that there are 10.7m diesel cars in UK and 18.6m petrol cars. \n“It is not unreasonable for retailers to make a fair profit but once again we need to ask why pump prices need to lag so far behind wholesale prices,” said Mr Gooding. Consumers have seen fuel prices for petrol tick higher in recent months after edging towards a £1 per litre earlier in the year . \nHowever, the renewed slump in oil prices has seen petrol and diesel trade at parity at some UK retailers.",

        "text": "(Adds details of profits, background, stock price)\nBy Nick Carey\nCHICAGO, July 14 (Reuters) - No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp on Tuesday reported a higher quarterly net profit, beating forecasts as productivity gains and lower fuel prices offset a drop in coal volumes that took a bite out of revenue.\nCSX shares jumped more than 3 percent in after-market trading, as the company also largely maintained its earnings outlook for the year despite the hit to its coal business.\nLike all the major railroads, CSX has been pummeled by a decline in coal volumes as power plants have switched to burning more natural gas due to lower prices for that fuel.

For us in Germany this means, that every debate about a Grexit must now belong to the past,\" said Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats, junior partner in the ruling coalition.\n\"For the Social Democrat party, I can say we'll vote 'yes' to starting negotiations on this third aid,\" he said. \"(Greece) is not only in a deep crisis, but needs to dramatically change in order to only just get out of this crisis.\" (Reporting by Caroline Copley and Michelle Martin; Writing by Paul Carrel ; Editing by Robin Pomeroy )",

Greece’s creditor institutions still view an austerity referendum, planned for July 5, as an issue for reaching an accord with Tsipras, according to an EU official.\nIn the event of Greek voters rejecting creditors’ demands, the nation’s financial system would have to be supported, Schwarzman said.\n“The pattern of withdrawals that have been fully covered by ECB loans would suggest that without those loans you’d have a collapse of banking system,” Schwarzman said. “How the ECB and Europe would transition that is something that I don’t know.”\nSchwarzman said he expected contagion from a Greek exit from the euro region would be contained.

All three offers were below the stocks’ average price in the 30 days prior to the announcements. Before the Chinese equity tailspin accelerated this month, 23 previous takeover bids this year were made at an average 17 percent premium, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe more than 150 percent gain in mainland stocks in the year prior to the rout drove a record number of going-private offers in the first half. The wave is continuing even as an unprecedented four-week plunge erased as much as $3.9 trillion in market value on the mainland. As the slump spreads to overseas-listed shares, managers are taking advantage of the opportunity to buy back their companies at steep discounts.\n“The end game is to list shares onshore,” Cheng Cheng, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities LLC, said by phone Friday. “A lot of these buyout deals are led by CEOs or founders who have a lot of company voting stock, so many of the offered premiums aren’t significant.”\nE-Commerce China Dangdang Inc., a Beijing-based online retailer, said July 9 that Chairwoman Peggy Yu Yu and CEO Guoqing Li offered $7.812 per American depositary receipt, or 18 percent below the stock’s 30-day average of $9.55.\nThe $68.50 bid for YY Inc., a Guangzhou-based social networking website, from both its chairman and CEO on July 9 was 4 percent below its average close over the previous month.\nThe Bloomberg China-U.S. index of the most-traded Chinese companies in the U.S. dropped as much as 18 percent from this year’s June 12 high before climbing 6.1 percent over the past two trading sessions. Dangdang slipped 3 percent Friday to $6.57, while YY rose less than 0.1 percent to $59.36.\nChina Nepstar Chain Drugstore Ltd., based in Shenzhen, said July 6 it received a $2.60 per share going-private proposal from Chairman Simin Zhang, three percent below its 30-day average.",

It is set to be presented to euro zone leaders meeting later on Sunday in Brussels. (Reporting by Jan Strupczewski and Tom Koerkemeier, editing by Philip Blenkinsop)",

Voyage time between Portland and southern Alaska should not delay the company's plans to begin drilling off northern Alaska in the Chukchi Sea later this month, Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) spokesman Curtis Smith said. \nThe Fennica is one of two ice management vessels in Shell's fleet of nearly 30 ships it expects to bring to the Chukchi off northern Alaska this summer. It contains the capping stack, or emergency equipment designed to contain a blown-out undersea well, required for the drilling. \"We do not anticipate any impact on our season as we don't expect to require the vessel until August,\" Smith said. \nShell believes that drilling can proceed while the Fennica is being repaired so long as it does not extend into the zone bearing oil and gas. It plans to build the foundations of wells and do other preparatory work before drilling into that zone. \nThe gash found in the Fennica was the second recent setback to Shell's Arctic ambitions. On June 30 the Interior Department informed Shell that established walrus protections prevent it from drilling two wells simultaneously that are less than 15 miles (24 km) apart, which means the company has to adjust its drilling this year. \nShell has not drilled in the Arctic since 2012 when after the summer drilling season an enormous drilling rig it was leasing broke free and grounded. If Shell discovers oil, it could begin producing in 10 or 15 years. After this season it will have spent about $7 billion on Arctic drilling off Alaska before producing oil. \nThe company needs two minor permits from the Department of Interior before it can start drilling.

In the period from 2018 to 2020, the remaining 1.3 TWh (150 MW) of the expiring power sourcing arrangement will be replaced by an internal power contract supplied by Hydro. \n\"Together with ongoing portfolio high-grading efforts and German exchange traded power prices falling around 20 euros since 2012, the new contract will further strengthen the competitiveness of our German aluminium triangle, consisting of the Neuss primary aluminum plant, the Alunorf hot rolling mill, and the Grevenbroich finishing plant,\" says executive vice president and Head of Rolled Products Kjetil Ebbesberg. \nHydro Neuss primary aluminium plant is 100 percent owned by Hydro and located in Western Germany, close to Düsseldorf. It is currently running at two-thirds of its total 235 000 mt annual capacity, delivering sheet ingot and recycled liquid metal to the next-door Alnunorf hot rolling mill. The Neuss primary smelter is currently undertaking a 50,000 tonnes capacity expansion of used beverage can (UBC) recycling capacity, contributing to lower metal cost and Hydro`s 2020 carbon neutrality target.",

        "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel held out the prospect of limited debt relief for Greece if it follows through on the terms of a third bailout, while insisting that Greek membership in the euro precludes a debt writedown.\nNations in the 19-member currency union will consider extending maturities and reducing interest rates on Greek bonds only after the first assessment of whether Greece is meeting pledges for more austerity and overhauling its labor market, the German leader said -- “not now, but then.”\nGreece’s wish to remain in the euro area rules out a “classic haircut, writing down 30 or 40 percent of the debt,” since it violates European law, she said.\n“Just imagine that with any country that has more debt than the Greeks had among euro members -- we would enter a completely hopeless situation,” Merkel said in an interview with German broadcaster ARD on Sunday. “You can’t have that.”\nFurther easing of repayment terms for Greek aid loans has been an option in euro-area negotiations since 2012. Ensuring that Greece’s debt is sustainable looms as one of the challenges when talks on the third bailout get under way.\nMerkel defended Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble’s breach of a taboo this month when he floated the idea of suspending Greece from the euro for five years. The proposal was meant to prevent a “catastrophic situation,” Merkel said.\n“The option was on the table, but we decided to take another one,” Merkel told ARD. “What counts is the result of these negotiations that took such a long time.”\nThe chancellor played down a disagreement between herself and Schaeuble a day after her finance minister confirmed differences between the two. In an interview with Der Spiegel, Schaeuble also said he’d quit if he were to conclude that he no longer had a say in her government.\n“I’ve received no such request for a resignation and I don’t have any intention of continuing this discussion,” Merkel told ARD. “We have work to do.”",

As part of the regulatory process, IAG has said that five daily slot pairs will be made available to other airlines at London Gatwick for flights between the airport and Dublin or Belfast. \nSpecifically, two of the five daily frequencies must be operated between Gatwick and Dublin, while one daily frequency must be operated between Gatwick and Belfast.The other two frequencies can be operated between Gatwick and either Dublin or Belfast. \nIAG said other airlines can apply for seats on Aer Lingus' short-haul network for their transfer passengers, on normal commercial terms. \nAer Lingus shareholders are due to vote on Thursday on whether to accept IAG's €1.36bn takeover offer.",

As part of the regulatory process, IAG has said that five daily slot pairs will be made available to other airlines at London Gatwick for flights between the airport and Dublin or Belfast. \nSpecifically, two of the five daily frequencies must be operated between Gatwick and Dublin, while one daily frequency must be operated between Gatwick and Belfast.The other two frequencies can be operated between Gatwick and either Dublin or Belfast. \nIAG said other airlines can apply for seats on Aer Lingus' short-haul network for their transfer passengers, on normal commercial terms. \nAer Lingus shareholders are due to vote on Thursday on whether to accept IAG's €1.36bn takeover offer.",

        "text": "TOKYO, July 15 Aluminium stocks at Japanese ports fell for the first month in more than a year in June as western banks started snapping up metal in Asia after spot premiums fell to two-year lows.\nAluminium stocks held at three major Japanese ports fell 0.5 percent to 499,900 tonnes at the end of June from a month earlier, trading house Marubeni Corp said on Wednesday.\nIt was the first decline since March last year.\nPrior to June's fall, stocks had risen to record levels over several months due to rising exports from China and slack demand in Asia.\nJapan is Asia's biggest importer of the metal used in cans and window frames.\nBig western banks were among buyers recently, after spot premiums over LME cash prices crashed to two year lows around $70-$80 a tonne in the second quarter.\nThat left reduced volumes available for Japan, an aluminium trader said.\n\"Some very big guys scooped up a bunch of metal. The stock is just moving elsewhere,\" the trader said. Storage costs in Asia outside Japan, are cheaper.\nBanks' buying has flared as financing has become profitable again.\nThe low risk strategy relies on purchasing aluminium, while simultaneously selling it forward for a profit, having locked in cheap finance and storage costs.\nThe gap between cash and three-month prices on the LME (LME) CMAL0-3 reached its widest in one year this week.\nQuarterly premiums for July-September shipments to Japan were mostly set at a six-year low of $100 a tonne as swelling Chinese exports piled more pressure on an already swamped market.\nTraders said some term shipments had been done in other parts of Asia at $95 a tonne over LME spot.\nThe nearly $300 drop in Japan premiums between the second and third quarters, the sharpest such decline on record, was in line with a global slump triggered by higher aluminium supply partly after the LME forced warehousing companies to shorten delivery times.\n(Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore )",

The stock is just moving elsewhere,\" the trader said. Storage costs in Asia outside Japan, are cheaper.\nBanks' buying has flared as financing has become profitable again.\nThe low risk strategy relies on purchasing aluminium, while simultaneously selling it forward for a profit, having locked in cheap finance and storage costs.\nThe gap between cash and three-month prices on the LME (LME) CMAL0-3 reached its widest in one year this week.\nQuarterly premiums for July-September shipments to Japan were mostly set at a six-year low of $100 a tonne as swelling Chinese exports piled more pressure on an already swamped market.\nTraders said some term shipments had been done in other parts of Asia at $95 a tonne over LME spot.\nThe nearly $300 drop in Japan premiums between the second and third quarters, the sharpest such decline on record, was in line with a global slump triggered by higher aluminium supply partly after the LME forced warehousing companies to shorten delivery times.\n(Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore )",

She currently serves as the CEO of Digital Assets Holdings LLC, a Bitcoin-related technology company.\nMasters, who was widely considered one of Wall Street's most powerful women, served as global head of JPMorgan's commodities business from 2007 to 2014 after a decade in trading and corporate roles.\nShe left the bank at a time when Wall Street banks begun to pare back their commodities trading businesses.\nSantander Consumer, which is a unit of Spanish bank Banco Santander SA, went public last year. Masters' appointment follows a number of executive changes at Santander Consumer. Santander Consumer chief executive and chairman Thomas Dundon stepped down in July and was replaced former chief financial officer Jason Kulas.\n(Reporting by Olivia Oran; Editing by Christian Plumb )",

She currently serves as the CEO of Digital Assets Holdings LLC, a Bitcoin-related technology company.\nMasters, who was widely considered one of Wall Street's most powerful women, served as global head of JPMorgan's commodities business from 2007 to 2014 after a decade in trading and corporate roles.\nShe left the bank at a time when Wall Street banks begun to pare back their commodities trading businesses.\nSantander Consumer, which is a unit of Spanish bank Banco Santander SA, went public last year. Masters' appointment follows a number of executive changes at Santander Consumer. Santander Consumer chief executive and chairman Thomas Dundon stepped down in July and was replaced former chief financial officer Jason Kulas.\n(Reporting by Olivia Oran; Editing by Christian Plumb )",

The blends include black, hibiscus, chamomile, mint and one called “harmony leaf.”\n“The tea market is one that’s evolving relatively quickly,” Fuqua said. “It’s one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world.”\nDunkin’ Brands Group Inc., the doughnut chain’s parent company, is trying to attract higher-end consumers and compete better with Starbucks Corp., which sells Teavana brand tea. Starbucks has said the tea category is worth $100 billion globally and is its fastest-growing product segment.\nCurrently, Dunkin’ sells regular, decaf and green tea. The premium teas, sold in triangle-shaped sachets, may eventually replace this line, Fuqua said.\n“Pending test results in Chicago, we think this is something that we’ll want to go broader with,” he said.",

The blends include black, hibiscus, chamomile, mint and one called “harmony leaf.”\n“The tea market is one that’s evolving relatively quickly,” Fuqua said. “It’s one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world.”\nDunkin’ Brands Group Inc., the doughnut chain’s parent company, is trying to attract higher-end consumers and compete better with Starbucks Corp., which sells Teavana brand tea. Starbucks has said the tea category is worth $100 billion globally and is its fastest-growing product segment.\nCurrently, Dunkin’ sells regular, decaf and green tea. The premium teas, sold in triangle-shaped sachets, may eventually replace this line, Fuqua said.\n“Pending test results in Chicago, we think this is something that we’ll want to go broader with,” he said.",

Toshiba has been unable to close its books for the latest business year due to the scandal, and suspended its year-end dividend payout. \nA Toshiba spokesman declined to comment. \nThe company will file its earnings in late August, the sources said. \nToshiba's stock price has sunk 27 percent since early April on Japan's biggest accounting scandal since camera maker Olympus admitted in 2011 that it used M&A deals to conceal investment losses. \nThe third-party panel, appointed by Toshiba after the accounting irregularities emerged, has found 170 billion yen in overstated profits, the sources said. This is far above the 54.8 billion yen the company initially disclosed in June. \nIn addition to a charge on the overstated profits, the sources said, Toshiba is expected to post writedowns on the value of chipmaking facilities and on deferred tax assets, or credits that can be used to reduce future tax bills. \nToshiba, which has 1.2 trillion yen in capital, is considering the sale of unused facilities, cross-shareholdings and non-core businesses to shore up its capital, the sources said. \n(Additional reporting by Reiji Murai; Writing by Taiga Uranaka; Editing by William Mallard and Edmund Klamann)",

        "text_full": "Toshiba to book $2-$3 billion losses over accounting scandal\nThe logo of Toshiba Corp is seen at the company's Hydrogen Energy R&D Center during its opening ceremony … \nBy Taro Fuse \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp expects to book charges of 300 billion to 400 billion yen ($2.4-3.2 billion) related to improper accounting, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday, as Japan's biggest accounting scandal in years expands. \nThe charges include six years of overstated profits uncovered by an independent panel probing the electronics conglomerate's accounting irregularities, as well as various writedowns, the people told Reuters. \nIt was not clear how much of that amount would be booked in the business year that ended in March of this year. Toshiba has been unable to close its books for the latest business year due to the scandal, and suspended its year-end dividend payout. \nA Toshiba spokesman declined to comment. \nThe company will file its earnings in late August, the sources said. \nToshiba's stock price has sunk 27 percent since early April on Japan's biggest accounting scandal since camera maker Olympus admitted in 2011 that it used M&A deals to conceal investment losses. \nThe third-party panel, appointed by Toshiba after the accounting irregularities emerged, has found 170 billion yen in overstated profits, the sources said. This is far above the 54.8 billion yen the company initially disclosed in June. \nIn addition to a charge on the overstated profits, the sources said, Toshiba is expected to post writedowns on the value of chipmaking facilities and on deferred tax assets, or credits that can be used to reduce future tax bills. \nToshiba, which has 1.2 trillion yen in capital, is considering the sale of unused facilities, cross-shareholdings and non-core businesses to shore up its capital, the sources said. \n(Additional reporting by Reiji Murai; Writing by Taiga Uranaka; Editing by William Mallard and Edmund Klamann)",

The measure slid 4.2 percent last week. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1 percent to 19,967.18 on Monday as Japan’s currency pared early-morning gains. European leaders gave Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras three days to enact their main demands into Greek law in exchange for another bailout.\n“We didn’t see a full agreement in the Greece talks, but they didn’t end in the worst-case scenario, and it’s positive that they’re still exploring a third bailout,” said Shoji Hirakawa, chief equity strategist at Okasan Securities Co. “But risks remain in this and you never know what will happen.”\nThe Topix fell 5.7 percent from a 2007 high reached June 24 through last week as uncertainty over Greece’s future in the euro and the impact of China’s stock rout drove gauges of global equity volatility higher. A measure of expected price swings on the Nikkei 225 closed Friday at an almost six-month high.\nThe Government Pension Investment Fund reported its annual results on July 10, and released figures showing its asset mix is closing in on the targets outlined in a radical overhaul in October.\nThe world’s biggest pension fund delivered a 12 percent return in the year ended March 31, the most since its 2001 inception. Domestic stocks made up 22 percent of its 137.5 trillion yen ($1.1 trillion) in assets, within the deviation limit of its 25 percent target.",

He was hired by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America to be its head of European fixed-income trading.\nBanks often have higher hurdles for hiring executives than hedge funds, as the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority must approve employees who have “significant influence” over regulated activities like trading. Foresti, who hasn’t been accused by the regulator of wrongdoing, was among those scrutinized by Deutsche Bank over a 2008 deal with an Italian bank, people briefed on the matter said in November.\nAnthony Payne, a spokesman for Brevan Howard, declined to comment on the hire. Foresti didn’t immediately respond to a telephone call.\nBrevan Howard is run by billionaire Alan Howard, 51, a co-founder and senior trader for its flagship master fund. That fund, with $21.7 billion in assets, mostly trades global interest rates and currencies, according to a person with knowledge of the firm. Foresti was head of rates and European credit-flow trading at Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, where he worked for 18 years.",

Oil production is currently constrained to approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is under constant review but there is no effect on the field's reservoir or resources, the company said. \nTullow said it has mobilised a team of experts to rectify the fault within the gas compression system and estimates that it will take approximately a further three weeks to reinstate gas export and full oil production. \nThe company will review its 2015 production forecast for Jubilee and provide an update on progress at its half-yearly results on 29 July. \nAtif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers , said that while the news is disappointing, he still sees value in Tullow as a standalone sector play. \n\"We do not expect there to be any material estimate changes and continue to see the upside risk as significant,\" he said. \nAt 11:44, shares were down 3.6% at 271.60p.",

Oil production is currently constrained to approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is under constant review but there is no effect on the field's reservoir or resources, the company said. \nTullow said it has mobilised a team of experts to rectify the fault within the gas compression system and estimates that it will take approximately a further three weeks to reinstate gas export and full oil production. \nThe company will review its 2015 production forecast for Jubilee and provide an update on progress at its half-yearly results on 29 July. \nAtif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers , said that while the news is disappointing, he still sees value in Tullow as a standalone sector play. \n\"We do not expect there to be any material estimate changes and continue to see the upside risk as significant,\" he said. \nAt 11:44, shares were down 3.6% at 271.60p.",

Naftemporiki said the entire package would be worth 10 billion to 12 billion euros. \nSuch measures may face resistance from the hard-left wing of Tsipras' Syriza party and from his junior coalition partner, the Independent Greeks, after the government campaigned for a resounding 'No' to more austerity in a referendum on July 5. \n(Reporting by George Georgiopoulos and Michelle Kambas; Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Larry King)",

The incident had no environmental repercussions. \nEnvironmental watchdog Greenpeace, in its 2012 Nuclear Stress Test report, called for the plant to be phased out due to its age and danger that a large earthquake could represent for the reactor core.",

The incident had no environmental repercussions. \nEnvironmental watchdog Greenpeace, in its 2012 Nuclear Stress Test report, called for the plant to be phased out due to its age and danger that a large earthquake could represent for the reactor core.",
