The data showed the surplus stood nearly quadrupled to 4.25 billion euros versus 1.27 billion euros in July 2014. Tourism revenues rose slightly to 2.87 billion euros from 2.77 billion euros in the same month last year. Last year Greece posted a current account surplus of 1.66 billion euros, up from 1.09 billion euros in 2013, helped by higher tourism revenues - its biggest foreign currency earner.

        "text_full": "Greek current account surplus widens in July, helped by ECB inflow\nATHENS, Sept 21 Greece's current account surplus widened sharply in July from the same month a year earlier, mainly due to a 1.8 billion euro inflow of bond gains from the European Central Bank which boosted the income balance, the Bank of Greece said on Monday. \"The relevant inflow, which contributed to a significant improvement in the secondary income account, was followed by the transfer of the funds to a Greek government account held with the ECB as cash collateral for the disbursement by the EFSM of 7.2 billion euros under a bridge financing agreement,\" the central bank said. The data showed the surplus stood nearly quadrupled to 4.25 billion euros versus 1.27 billion euros in July 2014. Tourism revenues rose slightly to 2.87 billion euros from 2.77 billion euros in the same month last year. Last year Greece posted a current account surplus of 1.66 billion euros, up from 1.09 billion euros in 2013, helped by higher tourism revenues - its biggest foreign currency earner.

They have lost a third of their value in the last 12 months (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

They have lost a third of their value in the last 12 months (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

MSCI's announcement has also hurt the index in recent weeks.\n(Reporting by Ursula Scollo, Writing by Mitra Taj; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

MSCI's announcement has also hurt the index in recent weeks.\n(Reporting by Ursula Scollo, Writing by Mitra Taj; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

Both sales and transactions were up at participating restaurants with many locations showing double digit increases. \n“Talk Like a Pirate Day is a fun event for our restaurants and our customers,” said Margo Mize, Senior Vice President of Marketing for LJS. “Our performance also underscores consumers’ affection for and connection with the Long John Silver’s brand.” \nConsumers who talked like a pirate on Sept. 19 at any participating Long John Silver’s restaurant received a free fish tender while customers who dressed like a pirate received a free 2-piece fish tender basket. \nCrews and customers took the promotion to heart and dressed the part from coast to coast. Photos can be seen at the LJS facebook page ( https://www.facebook.com/LongJohnSilvers/photos_stream ). LJS pirates could also be found roaming Times Square and appearing in the crowd at The Today Show. \nAbout Long John Silver’s \nLong John Silver’s is a classic American brand founded in 1969, and stands today as the nation’s largest quick-service seafood chain with more than 1,100 franchised restaurants in the U.S. and Asia.

        "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 21 A coalition of First Nations, environmentalists and companies including Canada's largest oil producer Suncor Energy called on Monday for industry and government to adopt a principle of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) when working with indigenous groups.\nIn a report the Boreal Leadership Council said FPIC - the right of indigenous people to offer or withhold consent to development that might impact their territories - is crucial to ensuring Canada's vast natural resources can be extracted.\nDisputes with First Nations communities have contributed to delays on a number of major energy infrastructure projects, most notably Enbridge Inc's Northern Gateway pipeline to Canada's Pacific Coast.\n\"Canada is establishing an international reputation for conflict with high profile examples of protest, legal action and community opposition,\" said Dave Porter of BC First Nations Energy and Mining Council. \"This report shows there is a different way forward.\"\nThe report, 'Understanding Successful Approaches to Free, Prior and Informed Consent in Canada', said seeking consent is central to building trust and transparency between indigenous communities and government and industry.\nSuncor is one of the largest producers in the oil sands, which are situated in the boreal forests of northern Canada, and said it welcomed the chance to learn more about what FPIC means to aboriginal communities.\n\"What's important to Suncor is that we continue to have strong, mutually beneficial long term relationships with First Nations,\" said Peter MacConnachie from Sustainability Suncor.\nThe company has been a member of the Boreal Leadership Council since it was founded in 2003.\nConflict between companies and aboriginal groups is most widespread in British Columbia, where huge swathes of the province are subject to land claims.\n\"There's a tremendous amount of time, money and opportunity lost by failing to reach agreement and by failing to move forward on how to work jointly with communities,\" said Karen Clarke-Whistler, chief environmental officer of TD Bank Group , another member of the council.\n\"If you can work it out on the ground in an equitable fashion then everybody wins.\" (Reporting by Nia Williams; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )",

Swiss watchdog says opens precious metal collusion probe Reuters - UK Focus – 8 minutes ago +0.66 \n(Adds additional WEKO comment, that UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) declined to comment, context) \nZURICH, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The Swiss competition regulator said on Monday it had opened an investigation into possible collusion in the precious metals market by several major banks. \nSwitzerland's WEKO watchdog said its investigation, the result of a preliminary probe, was looking at possible collusion in setting bid/ask spreads in the market by UBS, Julius Baer (LSE: 0QO6.L - news ) , Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) , HSBC, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) and Mitsui. \n\"It (WEKO) has indications that possible prohibited competitive agreements in the trading of precious metals were agreed among the banks mentioned,\" WEKO said in a statement. \nA WEKO spokesman said the investigation would likely conclude in either 2016 or 2017, adding that the banks were suspected of violating Swiss corporate rules. \nThe WEKO investigation is the latest in a string of probes into manipulation of the precious metals and foreign exchange markets. \nLast year, Switzerland's financial regulator FINMA said it had found a \"clear attempt\" to manipulate precious metals price benchmarks during a cross-market investigation into trading at UBS. \nIn May, four major banks pleaded guilty to trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates and, with two others, were fined nearly $6 billion in another settlement in a global investigation into the $5 trillion-a-day market. \nA spokesman for Zurich-based UBS declined to comment. The other banks were not immediately available for comment. \n(Reporting by Joshua Franklin; Editing by Miral Fahmy and Louise Heavens)",

Swiss watchdog says opens precious metal collusion probe Reuters - UK Focus – 8 minutes ago +0.66 \n(Adds additional WEKO comment, that UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) declined to comment, context) \nZURICH, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The Swiss competition regulator said on Monday it had opened an investigation into possible collusion in the precious metals market by several major banks. \nSwitzerland's WEKO watchdog said its investigation, the result of a preliminary probe, was looking at possible collusion in setting bid/ask spreads in the market by UBS, Julius Baer (LSE: 0QO6.L - news ) , Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) , HSBC, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) and Mitsui. \n\"It (WEKO) has indications that possible prohibited competitive agreements in the trading of precious metals were agreed among the banks mentioned,\" WEKO said in a statement. \nA WEKO spokesman said the investigation would likely conclude in either 2016 or 2017, adding that the banks were suspected of violating Swiss corporate rules. \nThe WEKO investigation is the latest in a string of probes into manipulation of the precious metals and foreign exchange markets. \nLast year, Switzerland's financial regulator FINMA said it had found a \"clear attempt\" to manipulate precious metals price benchmarks during a cross-market investigation into trading at UBS. \nIn May, four major banks pleaded guilty to trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates and, with two others, were fined nearly $6 billion in another settlement in a global investigation into the $5 trillion-a-day market. \nA spokesman for Zurich-based UBS declined to comment. The other banks were not immediately available for comment. \n(Reporting by Joshua Franklin; Editing by Miral Fahmy and Louise Heavens)",

We are prepared for both simple and complicated situations.\"\nEarlier on Monday Orban directed hundreds of new policemen to the southern border with Serbia to help manage record numbers of refugees and migrants trying to enter the European Union.\nOrban also said the migrant crisis could cost Hungary up to 200 million euros ($226.16 million).\nEconomy Minister Mihaly Varga was Quote: d as saying Hungary may need to amend its 2015 budget if the crisis persists as reserves have been severely depleted.

During the first half, the new executive and leadership teams have been listening hard to colleagues, customers, suppliers and shareholders. \n\"They tell us there is a lot for us to do. \n\"The immediate priority is to deliver a better shopping trip to stabilise trading performance. Our six strategic priorities will then deliver improvement in the core supermarkets, where we have the greatest opportunity.\" \nThose priorities were: to be more competitive, to serve customers better, find local solutions, develop popular and useful services, to simplify and speed up the organisation and to make the core supermarkets strong again.",

During the first half, the new executive and leadership teams have been listening hard to colleagues, customers, suppliers and shareholders. \n\"They tell us there is a lot for us to do. \n\"The immediate priority is to deliver a better shopping trip to stabilise trading performance. Our six strategic priorities will then deliver improvement in the core supermarkets, where we have the greatest opportunity.\" \nThose priorities were: to be more competitive, to serve customers better, find local solutions, develop popular and useful services, to simplify and speed up the organisation and to make the core supermarkets strong again.",

( http://1.usa.gov/1LYRk4e ) \nSeagate, which has about 52,200 employees worldwide, expects to complete the restructuring by the end of the December quarter. The company expects to incur most of the pretax charges in the first quarter, it said. \nSeagate has reported a fall in sales for the past two quarters, hurt by weak demand from original equipment manufacturers, including PC makers. \nResearch firm International Data Corp said last month that it expected a bigger drop in 2015 PC shipments than it had anticipated earlier due to a large inventory of notebooks and a strong dollar. \nTo help make up for a declining PC market, Seagate and rival Western Digital Corp are expanding into the growing market for cloud data storage products. \nSeagate's shares ended at $50.10 on Wednesday. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had fallen more than 24 percent this year. (Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Don Sebastian and Kirti Pandey)",

        "text": "(Adds futures prices, more company news items) LONDON, Sept 18 European equity futures fell on Friday, after the U.S Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates on hold was overshadowed by the Fed's downbeat comments on the state of the global economy. Futures on the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX , France's CAC and Britain's FTSE 100 all fell by between 0.3-0.5 percent. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Thursday in a bow to worries about the global economy, financial market volatility and sluggish inflation at home, but left open the possibility of modest rate rises later this year. \"Yes, we've got a reprieve on an immediate interest rate hike, but the reason for the stay of execution is rather bearish itself,\" said London Capital Group dealer Jonathan Sudaria.

Futures on the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX , France's CAC and Britain's FTSE 100 all fell by between 0.3-0.5 percent. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Thursday in a bow to worries about the global economy, financial market volatility and sluggish inflation at home, but left open the possibility of modest rate rises later this year. \"Yes, we've got a reprieve on an immediate interest rate hike, but the reason for the stay of execution is rather bearish itself,\" said London Capital Group dealer Jonathan Sudaria. Asian shares rose modestly on Friday on relief that the Fed had held off on raising interest rates but gains were capped by renewed concerns about the health of the global economy, in particular China. The Fed's decision also pushed up the euro against the dollar, and gains in the euro can often weigh on European carmakers and luxury good stocks as their exports typically benefit when the euro is weaker on currency markets.

Learn more... \nFri, Sep 11, 2015, 20:30 BST - UK Markets closed Russia central bank keeps rate unchanged on economic 'cooling' AFP – 42 minutes ago View Photo \n\nRussia's central bank on Friday opted to keep the main interest rate at 11 percent after lowering its rate five times this year, citing a serious deterioration in the economic situation. \nThe bank said in a statement it made the widely expected decision \"due to the higher inflation risks amid persistent risks of considerable economy cooling.\" \nThe bank also gave a gloomier growth forecast for this year, predicting a contraction of between 3.9 percent and 4.4 percent in 2015. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) had previously predicted that GDP would contract by 3.2 percent.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks mainland stocks in Hong Kong, is poised to rally to 10,900, or about 9 percent from Wednesday’s close, before moving lower again, he said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\n“This decline that we are anticipating is something that may be drawn out,” DeMark, 68, who has spent more than 40 years developing indicators to identify market turning points, said on Wednesday. “We are convinced that we will see a rally” in the short term, but “we see the markets eroding again,” he said.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index has advanced 5.3 percent to 3,243.09 in the past two days on speculation the government will step up stimulus to revive the flagging economy. It has rallied 11 percent since reaching this year’s low on Aug. 26, trimming its drop since mid-June to 37 percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index has jumped 9.6 percent since trading at a two-year low on Monday.\nToo Pessimistic Demark, who has advised hedge funds including George Soros’s Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors, has made several successful calls on the Chinese stock market in recent years. He correctly predicted on July 27 that the Shanghai benchmark would fall 14 percent to 3,200. In an interview on Aug. 25, he said the gauge will fall to 2,590, a level it hasn’t traded at since November.\nDeMark said Wednesday that policy makers’ intervention has delayed the decline and the short-term bounce is due because too many investors are pessimistic.\n“Every opportunity the market had to break down, there was a reaction by some influence, whether it’s the central bank or the government,” he said.\nWhen “too many people were negative,” the markets will “move sideways” or “go upside,” he said.\nDeMark’s Scottsdale, Arizona-based company makes money by charging traders for access to its indicators. It also sells subscriptions to the indicators on the Bloomberg Professional service.",

        "text": "Sept 21 Sears Holdings Corp named a former logistics executive at Amazon.com to a new senior role as the retailer seeks to revive itself by focusing on a loyalty program that hinges on integrating its online and store operations.\nSears said in a statement on Monday that Girish Lakshman, 51, would become president of fulfillment, a new position with oversight over supply chain and inventory management.\nLakshman was most recently the vice president of worldwide transportation strategy, technology and customer returns at Amazon, Sears said. He left Amazon in August 2014, according to the website of restaurant ordering and delivery firm GrubHub, where he is a board director.\nSears Chief Executive Edward Lampert said he expects Laksman to help strengthen Shop Your Way, a loyalty program that offers members points and tailored deals. The program accounts for three-quarters of the struggling retailer's overall sales.\n\"We must better connect our members with the products they want, in the way they want to receive them, and clear any hurdles that might get in the way of those goals,\" Lampert told employees in a memo on Monday.\nAs Sears continues to close physical stores, Lampert has said he wants to use technology and better integration of its online operations to squeeze more sales out of members, getting them to buy items they might purchase elsewhere.\nFulfillment could increasingly entail acting as a middleman for other retailer's goods. In May Lampert told shareholders that he wanted to add to a list of partners, which include Burger King and the Gap, that are linked to Shop Your Way.\nThe appointment of Lakshman is the latest in a recent string of senior hirings at Sears. Last month it named former Johnson & Johnson executive Lynn Pendergrass as president of hardlines, a category of goods that includes appliances, lawn and garden and tools.\nAnd last week Sears announced that Tom Park, who previously worked for divisions of Belkin International and Walt Disney Co, would become president of the Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands.

        "text_full": "Sears names ex-Amazon exec to new fulfillment post\nSept 21 Sears Holdings Corp named a former logistics executive at Amazon.com to a new senior role as the retailer seeks to revive itself by focusing on a loyalty program that hinges on integrating its online and store operations.\nSears said in a statement on Monday that Girish Lakshman, 51, would become president of fulfillment, a new position with oversight over supply chain and inventory management.\nLakshman was most recently the vice president of worldwide transportation strategy, technology and customer returns at Amazon, Sears said. He left Amazon in August 2014, according to the website of restaurant ordering and delivery firm GrubHub, where he is a board director.\nSears Chief Executive Edward Lampert said he expects Laksman to help strengthen Shop Your Way, a loyalty program that offers members points and tailored deals. The program accounts for three-quarters of the struggling retailer's overall sales.\n\"We must better connect our members with the products they want, in the way they want to receive them, and clear any hurdles that might get in the way of those goals,\" Lampert told employees in a memo on Monday.\nAs Sears continues to close physical stores, Lampert has said he wants to use technology and better integration of its online operations to squeeze more sales out of members, getting them to buy items they might purchase elsewhere.\nFulfillment could increasingly entail acting as a middleman for other retailer's goods. In May Lampert told shareholders that he wanted to add to a list of partners, which include Burger King and the Gap, that are linked to Shop Your Way.\nThe appointment of Lakshman is the latest in a recent string of senior hirings at Sears. Last month it named former Johnson & Johnson executive Lynn Pendergrass as president of hardlines, a category of goods that includes appliances, lawn and garden and tools.\nAnd last week Sears announced that Tom Park, who previously worked for divisions of Belkin International and Walt Disney Co, would become president of the Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands.

The deal will help Sampoerna, which has a market value of $23.2 billion, meet Indonesian listing rules requiring companies to have at least a 7.5 percent free float by January next year.\nA $1.4 billion deal would be the country’s largest rights offering, surpassing the $1.3 billion raised in 2011 by Indonesian lender PT Bank Mandiri, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sampoerna will use some of the rights offering proceeds to repay working capital facilities, the terms show.\nThe company aims to price the sale on Oct. 1 and will begin trading ex-rights on Oct. 20, the terms show.

That compared with half of all U.S. graduates who said they \"strongly agree\" that their undergraduate education was worth it.\nRecent graduates may be more likely than older alumni to have student loan payments, and the more undergraduate debt they have, the less likely they are to say their education was worth it, the report said.\n\"To some extent, older alumni might be more likely to say their education was worth it because they are further along in their careers and making more money,\" the report said.\nAround half of public and private nonprofit university graduates also felt strongly their education was worth it, compared to 26 percent of graduates of private for-profit universities, who are more likely to have more student loan debt, the report said.\nThe report was based on Web surveys from 30,151 U.S. alumni aged 18 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The surveys were conducted from Dec. 16, 2014 to June 29, 2015 and results have a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percent.\nRecent graduates who had supportive relationships with professors or mentors, an internship related to their studies, participated in extracurricular activities or a project spanning a semester or more were more likely to strongly agree that their education was worth the cost, the report said.\nSixty-three percent of recent graduates said they took out student loans for their undergraduate education, with a median loan size of $30,000, according to the report.\nMore than a third of recent graduates took out more than $25,000 in loans, and the report said the percentage is higher among recent black alumni and first-generation college students.\nThe report said U.S. News & World Report school rankings are only loosely related to their recent graduates' views that their education was worth the cost.

The surveys were conducted from Dec. 16, 2014 to June 29, 2015 and results have a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percent.\nRecent graduates who had supportive relationships with professors or mentors, an internship related to their studies, participated in extracurricular activities or a project spanning a semester or more were more likely to strongly agree that their education was worth the cost, the report said.\nSixty-three percent of recent graduates said they took out student loans for their undergraduate education, with a median loan size of $30,000, according to the report.\nMore than a third of recent graduates took out more than $25,000 in loans, and the report said the percentage is higher among recent black alumni and first-generation college students.\nThe report said U.S. News & World Report school rankings are only loosely related to their recent graduates' views that their education was worth the cost.

It had twice postponed its full-year results due to the accounting investigation, raising fears the laptops-to-nuclear power conglomerate could be delisted from the Tokyo bourse.\nThe accounting probe found in July that Toshiba suffered from dysfunctions in governance and a culture of discouraging employees from questioning their superiors, prompting previous CEO Hisao Tanaka and several other board members to step down.

The site, owned and operated by Suez, will supply the UK's largest cement kiln with a direct replacement for fossil fuels, manufactured using locally-sourced rubbish. \nThe site can handle up to 300,000 tonnes of residual waste each year, with nearly 70 percent coming from companies in the region, and the rest from household waste. \nOne and a half tonnes of the waste will produce the same energy as one tonne of coal. At full production capacity, the plant can consume up to 40 tonnes of the waste per hour. (Reporting by Geert De Clercq, editing by David Evans)",

Temasek raised its stake from 9.97 percent of ICBC’s H shares.\n“Temasek is confident in the long-term prospect of the Chinese economy,” spokesman Jeffrey Fang said by e-mail. “We actively seek opportunities to broaden and rebalance our exposure to the Chinese economy.”\nTemasek’s expression of confidence comes at a time when concerns are mounting that banks’ sour credit will surge and Chinese President Xi Jinping will struggle to revive the economy as a stock slump erased $5 trillion of market value. ICBC is trading at 0.8 times forecast book value for 2015, below the level seen during the global financial crisis and compared with an average of 1.3 times for the biggest global banks.\nZero Profit\nShares of ICBC have dropped about 30 percent in Hong Kong since June 12 after rallying 37 percent over the previous 12 months. The Beijing-based lender may report zero profit growth for this year on rising bad-loan charges and margin contraction, the weakest since data became available in 2001, according to analysts’ estimate in a Bloomberg survey.\nTemasek has been boosting its holdings of ICBC shares over the past four years. The firm bought 3.55 billion shares at HK$5.05 apiece from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in April 2012 and then disclosed the purchase of more the following month. In May 2013, Temasek bought 280 million more from Goldman Sachs at HK$5.5 a share, and in October 2014, raised the holding at an average HK$4.935 each. ICBC closed at HK$4.55 in Hong Kong on Wednesday.\nTemasek increased its exposure to China to 27 percent of its portfolio in the year ended March 31 from 25 percent in the previous year and broadened its investments from earlier ones in banks to include insurance, consumer and technology companies.",

        "text": "View Photo \n\nFacebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) is working on a 'dislike' button, its founder Mark Zuckerberg has announced, after years of resisting popular demand for such a tool. \nDuring a question-and-answer session at the social network's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, he revealed the button would allow Facebook users to \"express empathy\" with their friends. \n\"People have asked about the 'dislike' button for many years, and probably hundreds of people have asked about this, and today is a special day because today is the day that I actually get to say we are working on it, and are very close to shipping a test of it,\" he said. \nFacebook's trust and safety manager Emily Vacher told Sky News the new dislike button was not an encouragement to trolls. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) said: \"We certainly don’t want (trolling) on Facebook. We want it to be a place where people feel welcome and feel the warmth and sharing the information in their community. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) may end up that it’s not technically a dislike, it may be empathy.\" \n\"It’s something that we’re testing right now because we want people to be able to express themselves in the way that they feel most comfortable on Facebook.\" \nFacebook users have long pointed out the thumbs-up 'like'’ button is not suitable for certain status updates, such as bereavements or other bad news. \n\"If you are sharing something that is sad,\" Mr Zuckerberg, 31, acknowleged on Tuesday, \"then it may not feel comfortable to 'like' that post.\" \nHe added: \"It's important to give people more options than just 'like.'\" \nBut he said a 'dislike' tool was \"surprisingly complicated\" to develop. \n\"We don't want to turn Facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people's posts,\" he said. \nFor years, Facebook has resisted creating a 'dislike' button, fearing that it could fuel bullying or negativity. \nSome 4.5bn likes were generated daily as of May 2013, according to the social network.",

We want it to be a place where people feel welcome and feel the warmth and sharing the information in their community. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) may end up that it’s not technically a dislike, it may be empathy.\" \n\"It’s something that we’re testing right now because we want people to be able to express themselves in the way that they feel most comfortable on Facebook.\" \nFacebook users have long pointed out the thumbs-up 'like'’ button is not suitable for certain status updates, such as bereavements or other bad news. \n\"If you are sharing something that is sad,\" Mr Zuckerberg, 31, acknowleged on Tuesday, \"then it may not feel comfortable to 'like' that post.\" \nHe added: \"It's important to give people more options than just 'like.'\" \nBut he said a 'dislike' tool was \"surprisingly complicated\" to develop. \n\"We don't want to turn Facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people's posts,\" he said. \nFor years, Facebook has resisted creating a 'dislike' button, fearing that it could fuel bullying or negativity. \nSome 4.5bn likes were generated daily as of May 2013, according to the social network.",

In a new report published on Wednesday, the ratings agency opined that despite continued uncertainty in Greece and Ukraine, European retail sector outlook as a whole is likely to remain stable for the next 12-18 months. \nWith the exception of Russia, whose macroeconomic outlook remains weak, Moody's forecasts modest sales growth in all major European markets, driven by a return to GDP growth in Spain, Portugal and Italy and continued solid economic growth in the UK and Germany, where there is low unemployment and rising real wages. \n\"With consumer confidence at its highest point in many countries since the global recession and economic growth expected to continue across Europe, we expect the extra cash at consumers' disposal to translate into higher sales for retailers,\" said Sven Reinke, senior credit officer at Moody's. \nFurthermore, Reinke noted that as disposable incomes begin to rise consumers will choose to spend more on luxuries and treats like holidays than revert to their pre-downturn spending habits. \nOn the flipside, while UK retail sales are expected to grow moderately and could still outpace the rest of Europe, a potential interest rate rise in early 2016 could dampen demand for big ticket items such as cars, furniture and home improvements. \nEuropean retailers remain vulnerable to risks, such as a potential escalation of the Ukraine crisis or the evolving situation in Greece. In addition, the continued weak euro still weighs on most euro area retailers, although low commodity prices have largely offset the negative impact of more expensive imports from countries outside the single currency, Moody's noted. \nThe ratings agency also said that in light of shifting consumer behaviour, internet retailing will continue to take a higher share of the market, reaching 10% in Western Europe and almost 20% in the UK by 2020. Finally, Moody's would consider changing the sector outlook to positive from stable if annual retail sales increase by at least 2% over the next 12-18 months (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .",

( nyti.ms/1Lx5IOn )\n- Hewlett-Packard is eliminating about 10 percent of its jobs, or perhaps 30,000 of its 300,000 employees as it refocuses from costly, low-margin business services to higher-value consulting and cross selling.

After being confronted by the newspaper, he said in a statement that he was working in New York City during the 9/11 attacks but was not in the World Trade Center.\n\"As a young man, I made a mistake that I deeply regret and for which apologies may still not be enough,' Rannazzisi posted on Twitter on Wednesday. \"I don't know why I said this. This was inexcusable. I am truly, truly sorry.\"\nRannazzisi's upcoming special on Comedy Central, \"Breaking Dad,\" is scheduled to air on Saturday.\nFollowing the comedian's apology, the network said on Wednesday, \"We are very disappointed to hear about Steve's misrepresentations and are currently determining how we will move forward.\" (Editing by Piya Sinha-Roy ; Toni Reinhold)",

The company said British customers would be contacted soon to get their vehicles corrected. \nRupert Pontin, head of valuations at Glass's, said there was a \"great deal of concern\" over Volkswagen cars at auctions where the valuation conducts a lot of its price research. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is fair to say that there are also others who are less concerned and are essentially standing by the brand and its products,\" he added. \nNews (Other OTC: NWSAL - news ) of the scandal broke at a time when prices were already under pressure from an excess supply of Volkswagen cars in Britain as the company sought to increase its market share, Pontin said. \nSome car-dealers in Britain say they have not felt the impact of the biggest business-related scandal in Volkswagen's 78-year history. \n\"I did panic,\" Paul Wood, sales manager at Birchwood Motor Centre, said. \"But I don't think, when it comes to used (cars), that people are really bothered because it's all down to price, and they've still got a good name in terms of reliability.\" \n\"There's a lot of media hype about this,\" said the general manager of another car-dealer who asked not to be identified. \"What the trader is thinking is that if VW are doing it, everybody else has probably been at it as well.\" (Reporting by Angus Berwick; editing by William Schomberg and Adrian Croft)",

After that, those who rely on Autodesk's software will need to buy subscriptions for the products, all delivered via the cloud. \nThe move means near-term pain: shares of Autodesk have lost almost a quarter of their value in 2015, with investors grappling with the fact that the shift to the cloud will hurt earnings temporarily as the company's revenue model shifts from one-time software purchases to smaller recurring payments. \nBut Barron's notes that five years from now Autodesk could be earning over $4 a share, double its fiscal 2013 peak. The stock could benefit much sooner than that. \nAutodesk spokesman Noah Cole declined to comment on the specific forecast in Barron's but said the company planned to give new targets at its investor day on Tuesday. \nCole said the move to a cloud-based subscription model lowers upfront costs, which could help attract new customers. \n(Editing by Andrew Hay)",
