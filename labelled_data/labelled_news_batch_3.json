        "text": "* The Nikkei has risen 4.4 pct for the week * Gains limited before 3-day weekend - traders * Sharp tumbles on report it's set to post operating loss April-June By Ayai Tomisawa TOKYO, July 17 Japanese stocks extended their rise into a fifth day on Friday morning thanks to strength on Wall Street, but gains were capped as investors refrained from taking big positions before a long weekend. The Nikkei share average edged up 0.2 percent to 20,647.84 in midmorning trade. For the week, the benchmark has jumped 4.4 percent, heading for the biggest weekly gain since last October. Wall Street ended higher on Thursday helped by strong earnings reports. Market participants said that most investors will likely stay on the sidelines during the session before the long weekend in Japan. Monday is a national holiday in Japan. \"I don't think worries about a rout in Chinese shares are completely over,\" said Hiroyuki Nakai, chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. He said Japanese stock could be pressured again if foreigners turn sellers on any further shakeout in Chinese markets next week. However, retail investors who actively bought Japanese shares last week, could limit any downside. In the previous week when the Nikkei benchmark fell to a 3-month low, retail investors' net buying in Japanese cash stocks was 527 billion yen, the largest net buying since January 2014, according to data released by Japan Exchange Group. On the other hand, foreign investors' net selling in cash stocks was 438.3 billion yen, the largest since January this year. Combined with futures' net selling of 1.15 trillion yen, their total net selling was a record high, according to analysts. Financial stocks were higher, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rising 1.7 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group gaining 0.9 percent. Underperforming the market was Sharp Corp which tumbled more than 4 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that it is set to swing to an operating loss in the April-June quarter. The broader Topix was flat at 1,661.50 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 gained 0.1 percent to 15,012.54. (Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",

Sunac China Holdings Ltd. dropped a planned acquisition of the company in May after finding Kaisa’s net asset value was zero , Sunac Chairman Sun Hongbin said June 18.\nKaisa’s $800 million of 8.875 percent 2018 notes gained 0.56 cent to 49.78 cents on the dollar as of 11:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices. Its $500 million of 10.25 percent 2020 notes climbed 0.81 cent to 50.03 cents. Both securities traded at their highest levels since July 7.\nMost of the government-imposed restrictions were lifted in April, however courts are preventing sales after creditors sued the developer, Kaisa, which is based in the southern Chinese city, said then.",

Sunac China Holdings Ltd. dropped a planned acquisition of the company in May after finding Kaisa’s net asset value was zero , Sunac Chairman Sun Hongbin said June 18.\nKaisa’s $800 million of 8.875 percent 2018 notes gained 0.56 cent to 49.78 cents on the dollar as of 11:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices. Its $500 million of 10.25 percent 2020 notes climbed 0.81 cent to 50.03 cents. Both securities traded at their highest levels since July 7.\nMost of the government-imposed restrictions were lifted in April, however courts are preventing sales after creditors sued the developer, Kaisa, which is based in the southern Chinese city, said then.",

This is far above the 54.8 billion yen the company initially disclosed in June. \nIn addition to a charge on the overstated profits, the sources said, Toshiba is expected to post writedowns on the value of chipmaking facilities and on deferred tax assets, or credits that can be used to reduce future tax bills. \nToshiba, which has 1.2 trillion yen in capital, is considering the sale of unused facilities, cross-shareholdings and non-core businesses to shore up its capital, the sources said. \n($1 = 123.5800 yen)",

Futures show the odds of a rate rise by December have climbed to 74 percent from 67 percent a week ago, even as traders take it in stride: a gauge of Treasury market volatility has declined to near the lowest this year. The gap between yields for two-year notes, which are more sensitive to monetary-policy expectations, and 30-year bonds has narrowed for seven straight days.\n“The Fed will be looking to raise rates as soon as September,” said Tony Morriss, an interest-rate strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Sydney. The spread between two-and 30-year yields will continue to compress at least through the end of August, he said.\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.32 percent as of 10:42 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.125 percent security due in May 2025 was at 98 1/4.\nThe Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE Index, a measure of Treasury volatility based on options trading, fell to 72 basis points on Wednesday, a level unseen since April 27. The lowest the gauge has been this year is 70 basis points on Jan. 2.\nThe yield on two-year notes was 0.71 percent, compared with 3.03 percent for 30-year bonds. The spread narrowed to 231 basis points, the least since June 2. It hasn’t compressed for seven straight days since January 2014.",

Futures show the odds of a rate rise by December have climbed to 74 percent from 67 percent a week ago, even as traders take it in stride: a gauge of Treasury market volatility has declined to near the lowest this year. The gap between yields for two-year notes, which are more sensitive to monetary-policy expectations, and 30-year bonds has narrowed for seven straight days.\n“The Fed will be looking to raise rates as soon as September,” said Tony Morriss, an interest-rate strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Sydney. The spread between two-and 30-year yields will continue to compress at least through the end of August, he said.\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.32 percent as of 10:42 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.125 percent security due in May 2025 was at 98 1/4.\nThe Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE Index, a measure of Treasury volatility based on options trading, fell to 72 basis points on Wednesday, a level unseen since April 27. The lowest the gauge has been this year is 70 basis points on Jan. 2.\nThe yield on two-year notes was 0.71 percent, compared with 3.03 percent for 30-year bonds. The spread narrowed to 231 basis points, the least since June 2. It hasn’t compressed for seven straight days since January 2014.",

Learn more... \nTue, Jul 21, 2015, 02:19 BST - UK Markets open in 5 hrs 41 mins Toshiba shares jump more than 5% after accounting probe AFP – 21 minutes ago View Photo \n\nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Toshiba soared almost 6.0 percent shortly after the opening bell Tuesday following a revelation that the firm \"systematically\" inflated profits over several years. \nThey spiked 5.78 percent to 398.6 yen at the Tokyo Stock Exchange after a team of investigators the firm hired reported years of accounting irregularities. \nThe shares hovered at 390.0 yen, up 3.50 percent, some 20 minutes after the opening bell, amid reports that the firm's top managers will resign to take responsibility. \nThey outpaced the Nikkei index's rise of 0.50 percent to 20,753.79. \nToshiba's sharp rise came after a third-party panel issued a report Monday to spell out the firm's wrongdoings, easing a sense of uncertainty after the firm withdrew in May its earnings forecasts and said it might have to revise past financial statements due to possible accounting irregularities. \nThe firm's top executives were involved in \"systematically\" inflating profits by $1.2 billion over several years, the panel said in a stinging indictment of one of Japan's best-known firms. \nCurrent president Hisao Tanaka and his predecessor are both expected to resign over the profit-padding after investigators uncovered irregularities stretching back to 2008. \nThe panel, headed by a former Tokyo prosecutor, painted a picture of a corporate culture where underlings could not challenge powerful bosses who were intent on boosting profits at almost any cost. \nThe government's securities watchdog agency will consider a recommendation to the Financial Services Agency to impose a fine on Toshiba, according to major media, including the Nikkei and the Asahi Shimbun. \nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange is expected to designate the company to a special post to alert investors, Kyodo News said.",

Mr Osborne published a document pointing out that the Ministry of Defence alone owns about 1% of all UK land. \nThe Government sold assets worth £1.7bn in the last parliament - but Whitehall still owns land and property worth £300bn. \nThe departments are being asked to save up to 40% of their resource budgets by 2019/20. \nAnnouncing the Spending Review, which will be set out on 25 November, Mr Osborne warned Britain was still borrowing £1 for every £10 we spend and that national debt was still at its highest level for 50 years. \nThe planned £20bn savings follow the £12bn in welfare cuts and £5bn from tackling tax avoidance announced in the Budget earlier this month. \nMr Osborne said: \"This Spending Review is the next step in our plan to eliminate the deficit, run a surplus and ensure Britain lives within its means. \n\"We'll invest in our priorities like the NHS and national security. Elsewhere in government, departments will have to find significant savings through efficiencies and by devolving power, so people have a greater say over the issues that affect them and their communities.

Hammond said EU officials would be working over the summer to look at ways of making the reforms Britain is seeking. \n\"All 27 member states have told me clearly and categorically that they want Britain to remain part of the European Union,\" Hammond told a committee of lawmakers on Tuesday. \n\"Some have gone much further and said that the European Union without Britain would not be anything recognisable ... and they are prepared to work with us to try to ensure that the changes are made that will be necessary if Britain is going to be able to remain.\" (Reporting by Kylie MacLellan; editing by William James)",

Cellulosic ethanol costs are expected to converge on conventional costs in 2017 and drop below them in 2018, Raizen executives said. \nThe Piracicaba plant has been operating since December but is still struggling to overcome some of the early obstacles such as excess sand in the machinery and high enzyme costs. The plant can produce 26 million liters a year and plans to expand capacity to 42 million liters/year in October. \nIt is only expected to produce 10 million liters in 2015, however, as it works through operational kinks. \nRaizen hopes eventually to build eight second-generation ethanol plants along side some of its existing conventional sugar and ethanol mills over the coming years. \n(Writing by Reese Ewing; Editing by Bernard Orr)",

        "text": "Philippine casino stocks surged after the nation’s regulator said gaming revenue could increase 20 percent this year even as China’s anti-corruption crackdown has weakened casino revenues in other parts of Asia.\nBloomberry Resorts Corp., operator of Solaire casino in Manila, jumped as much as 6.8 percent, the biggest intraday rise since December 2014 and the biggest gainer on the Philippines Stock Exchange Index. Melco Crown Philippines Resorts Corp., operator of City of Dreams Manila, soared as much as 8.8 percent, halting a three-day slump. Travellers International Hotel Group, which runs Resorts World Manila, headed for its first gain in eight days.\nThe nation’s first-half gaming revenue grew 16 percent to $1.4 billion, Philippine Amusement & Gaming Corp. Chairman Cristino Naguiat said in a telephone interview. There’s a “good chance” it will reach $3 billion this year as he has predicted before, he added.\nChina’s crackdown on graft has weakened gaming revenues in the region, with Macau posting a 37 percent decline in the first half of the year as the campaign kept away Chinese gamblers. Genting Singapore Plc has also been hurt .\n“It’s proof that the Philippines has a good mix of foreign markets and that there are many who really want to come to the Philippines,” Naguiat said. “Bloomberry is raking the numbers in, while Melco has been steadily bringing in the people,” he said, adding that it’s getting tougher to get hotel rooms at the resorts.\nSouth Korea Tourists Tourist arrivals in the Philippines increased 8.2 percent to 2.23 million in the first five months of the year, with most coming from South Korea, who accounted for 24.5 percent of the total, followed by the U.S. and Japan, according to government data. China is the fourth largest source of tourists, with a 7.1 percent share.\nPhilippine gaming revenue could have been higher if not for China’s anti-corruption campaign, Naguiat said. The nation’s gaming revenue rose 14 percent to $2.5 billion last year from 2013.\nPremium Leisure Corp., among Melco Crown’s Philippine partners, advanced as much as 5.4 percent to a month’s high. Alliance Global Group Inc., parent of Travellers, gained 1.1 percent.",

        "text_full": "Philippine Casino Stocks Surge on Gaming Revenue Growth Forecast\nPhilippine casino stocks surged after the nation’s regulator said gaming revenue could increase 20 percent this year even as China’s anti-corruption crackdown has weakened casino revenues in other parts of Asia.\nBloomberry Resorts Corp., operator of Solaire casino in Manila, jumped as much as 6.8 percent, the biggest intraday rise since December 2014 and the biggest gainer on the Philippines Stock Exchange Index. Melco Crown Philippines Resorts Corp., operator of City of Dreams Manila, soared as much as 8.8 percent, halting a three-day slump. Travellers International Hotel Group, which runs Resorts World Manila, headed for its first gain in eight days.\nThe nation’s first-half gaming revenue grew 16 percent to $1.4 billion, Philippine Amusement & Gaming Corp. Chairman Cristino Naguiat said in a telephone interview. There’s a “good chance” it will reach $3 billion this year as he has predicted before, he added.\nChina’s crackdown on graft has weakened gaming revenues in the region, with Macau posting a 37 percent decline in the first half of the year as the campaign kept away Chinese gamblers. Genting Singapore Plc has also been hurt .\n“It’s proof that the Philippines has a good mix of foreign markets and that there are many who really want to come to the Philippines,” Naguiat said. “Bloomberry is raking the numbers in, while Melco has been steadily bringing in the people,” he said, adding that it’s getting tougher to get hotel rooms at the resorts.\nSouth Korea Tourists Tourist arrivals in the Philippines increased 8.2 percent to 2.23 million in the first five months of the year, with most coming from South Korea, who accounted for 24.5 percent of the total, followed by the U.S. and Japan, according to government data. China is the fourth largest source of tourists, with a 7.1 percent share.\nPhilippine gaming revenue could have been higher if not for China’s anti-corruption campaign, Naguiat said. The nation’s gaming revenue rose 14 percent to $2.5 billion last year from 2013.\nPremium Leisure Corp., among Melco Crown’s Philippine partners, advanced as much as 5.4 percent to a month’s high. Alliance Global Group Inc., parent of Travellers, gained 1.1 percent.",

Typically they do not require the bank to accept responsibility, instead settling the case with a payment and imposing monitors at the institution subject to the agreement. \nHowever, if the bank does agree to the DPA, it will only cover the bank rather than any individuals who worked for Barclays. \nIt is not the first time the bank has considered reaching such a deal with regulators. \nBarclays agreed to a non-prosecution agreement with US authorities over the Libor manipulation scandal in the summer of 2012. In that deal the bank admitted misconduct, paid $160m to the Department of Justice and agreed to help fraud investigators to the fullest extent possible in their probes into the bank. \nThe two-year agreement was extended last year in light of the looming foreign exchange benchmark investigations. \nThe SFO launched the probe in the summer of 2012 , looking into payments around the bank's £2bn fundraising in 2008. Barclays raised the money in the financial crisis to give it the extra financial firepower it needed to survive, while rivals Lloyds and RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) were bailed out by the taxpayer instead. \nThe deal was followed by a further £6.8bn fundraising in the Middle East, and fees totalling £300m caught the attention of the authorities.",

Typically they do not require the bank to accept responsibility, instead settling the case with a payment and imposing monitors at the institution subject to the agreement. \nHowever, if the bank does agree to the DPA, it will only cover the bank rather than any individuals who worked for Barclays. \nIt is not the first time the bank has considered reaching such a deal with regulators. \nBarclays agreed to a non-prosecution agreement with US authorities over the Libor manipulation scandal in the summer of 2012. In that deal the bank admitted misconduct, paid $160m to the Department of Justice and agreed to help fraud investigators to the fullest extent possible in their probes into the bank. \nThe two-year agreement was extended last year in light of the looming foreign exchange benchmark investigations. \nThe SFO launched the probe in the summer of 2012 , looking into payments around the bank's £2bn fundraising in 2008. Barclays raised the money in the financial crisis to give it the extra financial firepower it needed to survive, while rivals Lloyds and RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) were bailed out by the taxpayer instead. \nThe deal was followed by a further £6.8bn fundraising in the Middle East, and fees totalling £300m caught the attention of the authorities.",

Only then will we have a win-win situation,\" Tusk said.\nTusk spoke to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras by telephone earlier on Thursday.

Munger's office had argued it was unfeasible to meet that requirement given Illinois' antiquated computer systems and that the state could face stiff federal penalties for noncompliance.\n\"While the legal process will continue to play out, I am confident that the court will ultimately see that paying all state employees is the best and only way to protect the state from significant federal fines,\" Munger said in a statement.\nPaying workers will relieve some of the pressure on lawmakers and Governor Bruce Rauner to agree on a fiscal 2016 budget. The Illinois Senate will be back in session on Tuesday to take up a $2.26 billion, one-month budget and payroll bill passed by the House last week.\nRauner, who vetoed a $36 billion full-year budget passed by Democrats, has said he opposes their temporary budget as well.

CP has argued that it should not be held responsible for the tragedy. \nUnlike other companies targeted by a Lac-Megantic-related class action lawsuit, CP did not agree to the settlement and challenged the provincial court's jurisdiction in approving the deal. CP also asked the court in Canada's French-language province to shield it from future litigation. \nIn his judgment, Quebec Superior Court Justice Gaetan Dumas dismissed CP's motion as a \"not so subtle attempt\" to disrupt a settlement that called for C$430 million in compensation for victims of the rail tragedy. \nAlthough CP is not part of the fund and thus would not be on the hook for any of the promised funds, it is being threatened by a separate lawsuit. \nA spokesman for CP said the company is currently reviewing the judge's decision and has no further comment at this time. \n($1 = 1.2741 Canadian dollars) (With additional writing by Allison Martell; Editing by Christian Plumb)",

E-mini futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.5 percent, while Japan’s Topix index added 1.1 percent as the yen pared earlier gains.\nEuro-area leaders presented Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras with a laundry list of unfinished business from previous bailouts he’d pilloried in opposition and during six turbulent months in office.\n“Investors have taken the view for a long time that some sort of deal would happen in Greece, and that still appears to be on the table,” John Calverley, head of global thematic research at Standard Chartered Bank, told Bloomberg TV. “China is far more important. The government has already taken significant measures and we’ll have to see how it plays out this week.”\nChina reports trade data after two days of gains in the Shanghai Composite Index, where about half of companies were halted following a recent selloff. Even after an 11 percent two-day rebound, the benchmark equity gauge is down 25 percent since June 12.\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.2 percent, as did New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index.

E-mini futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.5 percent, while Japan’s Topix index added 1.1 percent as the yen pared earlier gains.\nEuro-area leaders presented Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras with a laundry list of unfinished business from previous bailouts he’d pilloried in opposition and during six turbulent months in office.\n“Investors have taken the view for a long time that some sort of deal would happen in Greece, and that still appears to be on the table,” John Calverley, head of global thematic research at Standard Chartered Bank, told Bloomberg TV. “China is far more important. The government has already taken significant measures and we’ll have to see how it plays out this week.”\nChina reports trade data after two days of gains in the Shanghai Composite Index, where about half of companies were halted following a recent selloff. Even after an 11 percent two-day rebound, the benchmark equity gauge is down 25 percent since June 12.\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.2 percent, as did New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index. South Korea’s Kospi index climbed 0.2 percent.",

Euro zone finance ministers will meet on Saturday to decide whether to recommend opening negotiations for a third bailout for Athens.\n* Global markets were also supported by a continued recovery in China's stock market, which rose strongly for a second day, helped by a barrage of government support measures.\n* Over the past two weeks Chinese authorities have cut interest rates, suspended IPOs, relaxed margin lending and collateral rules and enlisted brokerages to buy stocks, backed by cash from the central bank.\n* Investors will also look for clues regarding the timing of an interest rate hike in the United States, when Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen speaks at a conference in Cleveland, Ohio. Yellen, scheduled to speak at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT), will give her views on the prospects for U.S. growth, inflation and the job market.\n* Zillow's shares fell 2.6 percent to $83.01 in premarket trading, a day after the company said its chief financial officer is leaving the company to pursue other business interests.\nFutures snapshot at 7:01 a.m. ET:\n* S&P 500 e-minis were up 25.75 points, or 1.26 percent, with 233,940 contracts traded.\n* Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 54.5 points, or 1.26 percent, on volume of 34,100 contracts.\n* Dow e-minis were up 189 points, or 1.08 percent, with 34,380 contracts changing hands.

Euro zone finance ministers will meet on Saturday to decide whether to recommend opening negotiations for a third bailout for Athens.\n* Global markets were also supported by a continued recovery in China's stock market, which rose strongly for a second day, helped by a barrage of government support measures.\n* Over the past two weeks Chinese authorities have cut interest rates, suspended IPOs, relaxed margin lending and collateral rules and enlisted brokerages to buy stocks, backed by cash from the central bank.\n* Investors will also look for clues regarding the timing of an interest rate hike in the United States, when Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen speaks at a conference in Cleveland, Ohio. Yellen, scheduled to speak at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT), will give her views on the prospects for U.S. growth, inflation and the job market.\n* Zillow's shares fell 2.6 percent to $83.01 in premarket trading, a day after the company said its chief financial officer is leaving the company to pursue other business interests.\nFutures snapshot at 7:01 a.m. ET:\n* S&P 500 e-minis were up 25.75 points, or 1.26 percent, with 233,940 contracts traded.\n* Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 54.5 points, or 1.26 percent, on volume of 34,100 contracts.\n* Dow e-minis were up 189 points, or 1.08 percent, with 34,380 contracts changing hands.

        "text": "Investors who earn more than £5,000 a year in dividend income from their investments face higher tax bills from next April \nWealthy savers face a £7billion tax raid on the income they receive from stock market investments. \nExperts said that basic rate taxpayers, including pensioners who had built up a nest egg during their working lives, would also be affected. \nInvestors who earn more than £5,000 a year from the dividends paid by FTSE companies, such as Lloyds, Vodafone and BP, will face higher tax bills from next April under the levy. \nDermot Callinan, a partner and head of private clients at KPMG, the account-ancy practice, said: \"This is clearly a tax rise for affluent investors, who face much higher rates overall, but this won't just apply to the rich. \n\"Some of those affected will be pensioners paying basic-rate taxpayers because their earnings are less than £40,000 a year. \n\"If more than £5,000 comes from dividends, they will now pay tax on that income.\" \nCurrently, dividends paid to basicrate taxpayers are regarded as taxed already — companies pay a levy within the corporate tax system — so there is no further tax to pay. \nUnder the new rules, only the first £5,000 a year of dividend income will remain exempt. \nFor dividend income above this allowance, basic-rate taxpayers will pay 7.5 per cent. Higher-rate taxpayers will pay 32.5 per cent, up from 25 per cent currently. Additional rate taxpayers who earn more than £150,000 a year face a charge of 38.1 per cent on the dividend income, up from 30.56 per cent today. \nThe Budget document said: \"While these rates remain below the main rates of income tax, those who receive significant dividend income - for example due to very large shareholdings or as a result of receiving significant dividends through a closed company - will pay more.\" \nThe dividends paid by companies to shareholders average around 3.5 per cent. So someone who holds more than £140,000 worth of shares is likely to pay increased taxes. \nCalculations published by the Treasury showed the changes will raise £6.76 billion over the next five years. \ndan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk",

Higher-rate taxpayers will pay 32.5 per cent, up from 25 per cent currently. Additional rate taxpayers who earn more than £150,000 a year face a charge of 38.1 per cent on the dividend income, up from 30.56 per cent today. \nThe Budget document said: \"While these rates remain below the main rates of income tax, those who receive significant dividend income - for example due to very large shareholdings or as a result of receiving significant dividends through a closed company - will pay more.\" \nThe dividends paid by companies to shareholders average around 3.5 per cent. So someone who holds more than £140,000 worth of shares is likely to pay increased taxes. \nCalculations published by the Treasury showed the changes will raise £6.76 billion over the next five years. \ndan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk",

The company had already prepared for possible divestitures to address overlaps with Humana's business, he added. \nAetna is also required to pay Humana $1 billion if the deal is not closed by June 30, 2016, according to Tuesday's filing. \n(Reporting by Rosmi Shaji in Bengaluru)",

Those practices are at the heart of Japan's worst accounting scandal in five years. \nThe executives - including Tanaka, Vice Chairman and former president Norio Sasaki and adviser and former president Atsutoshi Nishida - strongly pressured Toshiba divisions in emails and meetings to meet budget targets, worsening the accounting improprieties, the source said. \nA company spokesman said he could not comment as the panel's report has not been released. \nThe company said on Friday the independent panel, hired by Toshiba after the irregularities emerged in April, will report its findings to the company on Monday, and Toshiba would announce them on Tuesday. \nAs one measure to prevent a recurrence of the problems, Toshiba is considering naming an outsider to head its Audit Committee, said a Toshiba official familiar with the matter. \n(Additional reporting by Yoshiyasu Shida; Writing by William Mallard; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)",

S.Africa's Amplats still weighing disposal options, H1 earnings soar Reuters - UK Focus – 14 minutes ago -12.90 \n(Adds details) \nJOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Reuters) - South Africa's Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) said on Monday it was still considering how to dispose of its labour-intensive Rustenburg and Union operations but a stock market floatation was a likely option. \n\"Currently both options for divestment - an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or a trade sale - are still being worked on, and whilst it remains practicable, both options will be kept open,\" Amplats said in a statement accompanying the release of its first-half results. \nAmplats' chief executive Chris Griffith said in a conference call with journalists that he felt an IPO was the more likely option but probably not before early 2017. \nThe world's top platinum producer also said first-half headline earnings came in at 2.47 billion rand ($200 million), bang in line with what the company previously flagged and an increase of almost 15-fold, underscoring the impact of a five-month strike last year. \nThat strike, lead by the hardline Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, is one reason why South African platinum assets are not easy to dispose of at the moment, as the labour environment is widely seen as volatile. \nAnother is platinum's spot price, which last week fell below $1,000 an ounce for the first time in 6-1/2 years, a reflection of weakness across the precious metals' board in the face of a rising dollar. \n($1 = 12.3998 rand) (Reporting by Ed Stoddard and Zandi Shabalala; Editing by Tiisetso Motsoeneng)",

S.Africa's Amplats still weighing disposal options, H1 earnings soar Reuters - UK Focus – 14 minutes ago -12.90 \n(Adds details) \nJOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Reuters) - South Africa's Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) said on Monday it was still considering how to dispose of its labour-intensive Rustenburg and Union operations but a stock market floatation was a likely option. \n\"Currently both options for divestment - an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or a trade sale - are still being worked on, and whilst it remains practicable, both options will be kept open,\" Amplats said in a statement accompanying the release of its first-half results. \nAmplats' chief executive Chris Griffith said in a conference call with journalists that he felt an IPO was the more likely option but probably not before early 2017. \nThe world's top platinum producer also said first-half headline earnings came in at 2.47 billion rand ($200 million), bang in line with what the company previously flagged and an increase of almost 15-fold, underscoring the impact of a five-month strike last year. \nThat strike, lead by the hardline Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, is one reason why South African platinum assets are not easy to dispose of at the moment, as the labour environment is widely seen as volatile. \nAnother is platinum's spot price, which last week fell below $1,000 an ounce for the first time in 6-1/2 years, a reflection of weakness across the precious metals' board in the face of a rising dollar. \n($1 = 12.3998 rand) (Reporting by Ed Stoddard and Zandi Shabalala; Editing by Tiisetso Motsoeneng)",

The company operates Waldbaum’s, Food Emporium, Super Fresh, Pathmark and Food Basics, as well as its namesake stores. It has more than 300 stores, according to its website .\nA&P has struggled of late to compete with newcomers including Whole Foods Market Inc. and Trader Joe’s Co. Its stores came to seem dated, and the company sagged under high pension costs and other labor expenses.\nThe Montvale, New Jersey-based company listed assets and debt of more than $1 billion each in its bankruptcy filing. Among the largest unsecured A&P creditors listed in court papers were C & S Wholesale Grocers and McKesson Drug Co.\nThe grocer previously filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and emerged in 2012 as a closely held company owned by an investor group that included Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa Cos.\nA&P was founded in lower Manhattan in 1859 as a mail-order tea and spice business by merchants George Huntington Hartford and George Gilman.\nHorse-drawn carts soon spread the business north, south and west, turning A&P into the largest grocer in the U.S. By 1929, the company had more than 15,000 stores and $1 billion in sales, and its Eight O’Clock Breakfast Coffee helped take the edge off Americans’ morning grind.\nThe case is in re The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 15-23007, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).",

The company operates Waldbaum’s, Food Emporium, Super Fresh, Pathmark and Food Basics, as well as its namesake stores. It has more than 300 stores, according to its website .\nA&P has struggled of late to compete with newcomers including Whole Foods Market Inc. and Trader Joe’s Co. Its stores came to seem dated, and the company sagged under high pension costs and other labor expenses.\nThe Montvale, New Jersey-based company listed assets and debt of more than $1 billion each in its bankruptcy filing. Among the largest unsecured A&P creditors listed in court papers were C & S Wholesale Grocers and McKesson Drug Co.\nThe grocer previously filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and emerged in 2012 as a closely held company owned by an investor group that included Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa Cos.\nA&P was founded in lower Manhattan in 1859 as a mail-order tea and spice business by merchants George Huntington Hartford and George Gilman.\nHorse-drawn carts soon spread the business north, south and west, turning A&P into the largest grocer in the U.S. By 1929, the company had more than 15,000 stores and $1 billion in sales, and its Eight O’Clock Breakfast Coffee helped take the edge off Americans’ morning grind.\nThe case is in re The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 15-23007, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).",

The ruble strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 57 per dollar by 1:35 p.m. in Moscow after weakening 1 percent last week.\nA deceleration in inflation from a 13-year high is giving the Bank of Russia room to keep easing monetary policy after lowering key interest rates by 550 basis points this year. Policy makers may cut borrowing costs by an additional 150 basis points by the end of 2015, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Finance Ministry sold 75 billion rubles ($1.3 billion) of debut inflation-linked securities last week.\n“OFZs are rising as investors still expect key rate cuts later in 2015-2016,” Dmitry Polevoy, the chief economist for Russia at ING Groep NV in Moscow, said by e-mail. “The sale of inflation linkers last week seems to have spurred some reassessment of inflation and monetary-policy outlook.”\nData last Wednesday showed weekly consumer-price growth slowed to 0.1 percent from 0.7 percent in the seven days to July 13. Forward-rate agreements signal 39 basis points of rate cuts in the next three months, close to this year’s low in mid-June.\nLower Rates Russian local-currency sovereign bonds have returned 31 percent this year, the most among 31 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg.\n“OFZs have been rising because the placement of inflation-linkers seems to have returned foreign investor appetite to the Russian market and some local players reassessed their inflation expectation toward a decline,” Dmitry Postolenko, a money manager at Kapital Asset Management LLC in Moscow, said in an e-mail.\nThe Micex Index of stocks retreated 0.2 percent, having risen 1.6 percent last week. Out of 50 Micex shares, 34 traded above the 50-day moving average on July 17, the most since March 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe ruble’s one-month volatility declined to 15.68, the lowest since Oct. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",

Its stock price peaked around 57 euros just before the company surprised investors with a capital hike in mid-February.\nShares of Rocket closed at 40.94 euros, up 2.21 percent on Monday but lower than the 42.50 euro price at which its shares were originally priced in early October last year but just above its 37-euro closing price after its first day of public trading.\nThe company said it had committed to a three-month lock-up on further stock or equity-linked transactions. J.P. Morgan is the sole bookrunner for the bond offering, the company said.\nLast month, at its first annual shareholder meeting, Rocket won investor support to raise as much as 4.5 billion euros ($5 billion) over the next five years to invest in new ventures and increase stakes in its existing start-ups.

The Ministry of Finance will sell 2.5 trillion yen ($20 billion) of five-year JGBs at the auction.\nThe JGB market showed little reaction to the well-anticipated decision by the Bank of Japan to stand pat on monetary policy.\nJGBs also took in stride the BOJ's decision to cut its growth forecast for the year ending in March 2016 to a 1.7 percent increase from the 2.0 percent expansion it forecast in April, as the move had been widely reported beforehand.\n($1 = 123.3900 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",

Supermarket Pricing Is Confusing, Says CMA By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 10 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has criticised major supermarkets after a three-month probe, saying their pricing is \"confusing\". \nThe investigation was launched after a super-complaint from the consumer group Which?, which contended that pricing practices in the supermarket industry were \"misleading and opaque\". \nAs part of its investigation the CMA found examples of \"pricing and promotional practices that have the potential to confuse or mislead consumers\", but concluded that the problems are not widespread and systematic. \nThe CMA has announced a series of measures designed to bring more clarity to the supermarket sector, including recommending the government publish guidelines on best practices. \nNisha Arora, CMA Senior Director, Consumer, said: \"We welcomed the super-complaint, which presented us with information that demanded closer inspection. \n\"We have gathered and examined a great deal of further evidence over the past 3 months and are now announcing what further action we are taking and recommending others to take. \n\"We have found that, whilst supermarkets want to comply with the law and shoppers enjoy a wide range of choices, with an estimated 40% of grocery spending being on items on promotion, there are still areas of poor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers. \n\"So we are recommending further action to improve compliance and ensure that shoppers have clear, accurate information.\" \nIn reponse to the report Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: “The CMA’s report confirms what our research over many years has repeatedly highlighted: there are hundreds of misleading offers on the shelves every day that do not comply with the rules. \n\"This puts supermarkets on notice to clean up their pricing practices or face legal action. \n“Given the findings, we now expect to see urgent enforcement action from the CMA. \n\"The Government must also quickly strengthen the rules so that retailers have no more excuses. \n“As a result of our super-complaint, if all the changes are implemented widely, this will be good for consumers, competition and, ultimately, the economy.” \nMore follows...",

Supermarket Pricing Is Confusing, Says CMA By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 10 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has criticised major supermarkets after a three-month probe, saying their pricing is \"confusing\". \nThe investigation was launched after a super-complaint from the consumer group Which?, which contended that pricing practices in the supermarket industry were \"misleading and opaque\". \nAs part of its investigation the CMA found examples of \"pricing and promotional practices that have the potential to confuse or mislead consumers\", but concluded that the problems are not widespread and systematic. \nThe CMA has announced a series of measures designed to bring more clarity to the supermarket sector, including recommending the government publish guidelines on best practices. \nNisha Arora, CMA Senior Director, Consumer, said: \"We welcomed the super-complaint, which presented us with information that demanded closer inspection. \n\"We have gathered and examined a great deal of further evidence over the past 3 months and are now announcing what further action we are taking and recommending others to take. \n\"We have found that, whilst supermarkets want to comply with the law and shoppers enjoy a wide range of choices, with an estimated 40% of grocery spending being on items on promotion, there are still areas of poor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers. \n\"So we are recommending further action to improve compliance and ensure that shoppers have clear, accurate information.\" \nIn reponse to the report Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: “The CMA’s report confirms what our research over many years has repeatedly highlighted: there are hundreds of misleading offers on the shelves every day that do not comply with the rules. \n\"This puts supermarkets on notice to clean up their pricing practices or face legal action. \n“Given the findings, we now expect to see urgent enforcement action from the CMA. \n\"The Government must also quickly strengthen the rules so that retailers have no more excuses. \n“As a result of our super-complaint, if all the changes are implemented widely, this will be good for consumers, competition and, ultimately, the economy.” \nMore follows...",

It slid below 2015’s average of 85 this week. A surge in volatility last year prompted U.S. officials to consider making companies that use automated trading register with the government, a report released on July 13 showed.\nThe biggest issues driving the Treasury market during the past month are being resolved. Greece agreed a bailout package this week, while a monthlong selloff in the Shanghai Composite Index is easing. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen reiterated Wednesday the central bank will probably raise its main interest rate this year, while subsequent increases will be gradual.\n“The biggest concerns now seem to be settling down,” said\nTomohisa Fujiki, head of interest-rate strategy for Japan at BNP Paribas SA in Tokyo. “Treasuries could be staying relatively within a small range,” he said. The company’s U.S. unit is one of the 22 primary dealers that underwrite the U.S. debt.\nThe benchmark 10-year note yield rose two basis points to 2.38 percent as of 11:57 a.m. Tokyo time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.

Ten-year yields plunged as much as 34 basis points that day, the biggest intraday decline since 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe volatility was enough to spur the Treasury Department, Fed, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate.\nThe agencies issued a 76-page joint report , saying many traders were concerned about a lack of liquidity , and some of them disengaged their automated price-quoting systems and used manual or voice trading instead to reduce risk.\nIn addition to the study of whether to register companies that use automated trading, the report also said officials plan to review whether companies should be required to submit reports on their trading activity.",
