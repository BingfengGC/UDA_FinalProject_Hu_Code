JPM attributed the downgrade to weaker industry trends and low visibility in trends. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the announcement on Wednesday highlighted three incremental concerns: lower-than-expected US community college enrolments, higher returns from US book retailers and lower-than-expected textbook sales in South Africa. \nThe bank cut its 2015 earnings per share estimate to 70p from 73.6p and its 2015 estimate to 63.3p from 71p. \n\"We expect a wide consensus earnings range for 2016, and think improving and consistent underlying growth trends are needed for the shares to outperform,\" it said. \nStill, the bank said the nine-month announcement from Pearson does not change its view regarding the potential long-term growth opportunity in education, including the potential for the company to sell more products/services to more customers. \nAt 1047 BST, Pearson shares were down 4.1% at 957.50p.",

JPM attributed the downgrade to weaker industry trends and low visibility in trends. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the announcement on Wednesday highlighted three incremental concerns: lower-than-expected US community college enrolments, higher returns from US book retailers and lower-than-expected textbook sales in South Africa. \nThe bank cut its 2015 earnings per share estimate to 70p from 73.6p and its 2015 estimate to 63.3p from 71p. \n\"We expect a wide consensus earnings range for 2016, and think improving and consistent underlying growth trends are needed for the shares to outperform,\" it said. \nStill, the bank said the nine-month announcement from Pearson does not change its view regarding the potential long-term growth opportunity in education, including the potential for the company to sell more products/services to more customers. \nAt 1047 BST, Pearson shares were down 4.1% at 957.50p.",

World Bank trims Asia forecast but says no China hard landing AFP – 35 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe World Bank on Monday cut its growth forecasts for developing economies in East Asia and the Pacific but allayed fears of a hard landing for China's slowing economy. \nThe bank also said it expects any increase in US interest rates to have an orderly impact but warned of a risk that markets could react sharply, causing currencies to depreciate further in the region. \nIn a report on 14 economies led by China, the bank called on the countries to mitigate the impact of the slowing Chinese economy and an increase in US interest rates by adopting \"prudent macro-economic management\" and deeper structural reforms. \n\"The baseline growth projections for China assume a further gradual slowdown in 2016-17,\" the bank said, allaying concerns that the world's second largest economy could experience an abrupt slowdown following recent stock market turmoil and a softening manufacturing sector. \n\"China has sufficient policy buffers to address these risks and prevent a sharp slowdown,\" it said. \nIn its updated outlook for the region, the bank said China's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 6.9 percent this year, moderating to 6.7 percent next year and 6.5 percent in 2017. China's GDP rose 7.3 percent in 2014. \nThe forecasts were slightly lower than the bank's projections made in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) . \nFor developing economies in the East Asia-Pacific region, average growth is forecast at 6.5 percent this year, 6.4 percent next year and 6.3 percent in 2017. This is down from 6.8 percent actual growth in 2014. \n\"This reflects mainly a moderate slowdown in China,\" the bank said.",

Learn more... \nMon, Oct 5, 2015, 07:43 BST - UK Markets open in 17 mins. World Bank trims Asia forecast but says no China hard landing AFP – 35 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe World Bank on Monday cut its growth forecasts for developing economies in East Asia and the Pacific but allayed fears of a hard landing for China's slowing economy. \nThe bank also said it expects any increase in US interest rates to have an orderly impact but warned of a risk that markets could react sharply, causing currencies to depreciate further in the region. \nIn a report on 14 economies led by China, the bank called on the countries to mitigate the impact of the slowing Chinese economy and an increase in US interest rates by adopting \"prudent macro-economic management\" and deeper structural reforms. \n\"The baseline growth projections for China assume a further gradual slowdown in 2016-17,\" the bank said, allaying concerns that the world's second largest economy could experience an abrupt slowdown following recent stock market turmoil and a softening manufacturing sector. \n\"China has sufficient policy buffers to address these risks and prevent a sharp slowdown,\" it said. \nIn its updated outlook for the region, the bank said China's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 6.9 percent this year, moderating to 6.7 percent next year and 6.5 percent in 2017. China's GDP rose 7.3 percent in 2014. \nThe forecasts were slightly lower than the bank's projections made in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) . \nFor developing economies in the East Asia-Pacific region, average growth is forecast at 6.5 percent this year, 6.4 percent next year and 6.3 percent in 2017. This is down from 6.8 percent actual growth in 2014. \n\"This reflects mainly a moderate slowdown in China,\" the bank said.",

Since the beginning of the year, the fund advanced 3.1 percent, according to the statement, compared with a 4.4 percent decline in the index. APS did not elaborate on the trades or positions of the fund and related strategies, which have about $2 billion in assets.\nHedge funds investing in China are on track to report their fourth monthly loss in a row in September as stock markets extended their rout, according to the Singapore-based data provider Eurekahedge Pte. The Eurekahedge Greater China Hedge Fund Index declined 6.6 percent in August, cutting the gain for the first eight months of 2015 to 3 percent, according to the data provider, which has not yet reported numbers for September.\nThe Shanghai benchmark index tumbled almost 29 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 as concerns about the world’s second-largest economy intensified, the worst quarterly decline since the first three months of 2008. The rout has spurred losses for long-only managers and has prompted the nation’s regulators to scrutinize practices they deem harmful to the markets, such as short-selling shares.\nLong-Short Fund APS’s Greater China Long/Short Fund declined 2.9 percent in the month through Sep. 25, the asset management firm said. The fund, with $79 million of assets, was still up 24 percent since the beginning of the year through Sept. 25. The APS Asia-Pacific Long/Short Fund, with $305 million of assets, rose 1.1 percent in the month and 19 percent since the beginning of the year.\nFounded in 1995, APS manages money for institutional investors such as pension funds, endowments, foundations, family offices, funds of funds, and sovereign wealth funds, according to Wong Kok Hoi, founder and chief investment officer. More than half of the investors are based in North America, with the remainder evenly split between Asia, Europe and Australia, Wong said in April.",

Official figures showed British consumer price inflation was zero in the 12 months to August. \n\"The low level of inflation expectations probably will not prevent pay growth picking up a bit in the coming year, but probably does signal that any pickup in pay will be modest rather than sharp,\" Citi economist Michael Saunders said. \n\"Against this background - and with signs that growth is slowing - there is no urgent need for the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to hike rates at present,\" he said, adding that Citi expected that rates would not rise in the next 12 months.

Official figures showed British consumer price inflation was zero in the 12 months to August. \n\"The low level of inflation expectations probably will not prevent pay growth picking up a bit in the coming year, but probably does signal that any pickup in pay will be modest rather than sharp,\" Citi economist Michael Saunders said. \n\"Against this background - and with signs that growth is slowing - there is no urgent need for the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to hike rates at present,\" he said, adding that Citi expected that rates would not rise in the next 12 months.

The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index advanced 2.5 percent.\nLisbon's benchmark PSI-20 index rose 1.9 percent after Portugal's centre-right government on Sunday won an election, albeit without a majority.\nFrance's CAC gained 2.7 percent after data showed that French services activity accelerated in September more than previously thought.\nGerman potash producer K+S slumped 20 percent, however, after Potash Corp withdrew its bid for K+S.\nCarmaker Volkswagen fell around 5 percent to four-year lows. Credit default spreads on VW jumped, another effect of the car maker's admission it cheated on diesel emissions tests in the United States.\nGlencore extended its rebound from a sell-off a week ago, rising around 10 percent on Monday after a surge in its Hong Kong-listed shares. The company said it knew of no reason for the swings.\nSome traders said Glencore's shares were buoyed by talk the company might sell some of its agricultural assets to cut its debt.\n\"Sentiment is improving towards Glencore on the signs that it may be able to sell some of its assets,\" said Thames Capital Markets' trader Nav Banwait.\nGains by steelmaker ArcelorMittal also helped mining stocks. ArcelorMittal rose 5 percent after Citigroup raised its rating on the stock to \"buy\" from \"sell\".\nEuropean stock markets remain below the peaks for 2015 reached around April. Concern China's economy was slowing pulled them lower in the last quarter.\nGermany's DAX, which rose 2 percent on Monday, remains some 20 percent below a record high reached in April. Overall sentiment remains \"neutral\", said Peregrine & Black senior sales trader Markus Huber.\nToday's European research round-up",

The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index advanced 2.5 percent.\nLisbon's benchmark PSI-20 index rose 1.9 percent after Portugal's centre-right government on Sunday won an election, albeit without a majority.\nFrance's CAC gained 2.7 percent after data showed that French services activity accelerated in September more than previously thought.\nGerman potash producer K+S slumped 20 percent, however, after Potash Corp withdrew its bid for K+S.\nCarmaker Volkswagen fell around 5 percent to four-year lows. Credit default spreads on VW jumped, another effect of the car maker's admission it cheated on diesel emissions tests in the United States.\nGlencore extended its rebound from a sell-off a week ago, rising around 10 percent on Monday after a surge in its Hong Kong-listed shares. The company said it knew of no reason for the swings.\nSome traders said Glencore's shares were buoyed by talk the company might sell some of its agricultural assets to cut its debt.\n\"Sentiment is improving towards Glencore on the signs that it may be able to sell some of its assets,\" said Thames Capital Markets' trader Nav Banwait.\nGains by steelmaker ArcelorMittal also helped mining stocks. ArcelorMittal rose 5 percent after Citigroup raised its rating on the stock to \"buy\" from \"sell\".\nEuropean stock markets remain below the peaks for 2015 reached around April. Concern China's economy was slowing pulled them lower in the last quarter.\nGermany's DAX, which rose 2 percent on Monday, remains some 20 percent below a record high reached in April. Overall sentiment remains \"neutral\", said Peregrine & Black senior sales trader Markus Huber.\nToday's European research round-up",

The sooner they act, the better.\"\nThe federal government is currently scraping just under its $18 trillion legal debt cap, with political wrangling over fiscal policy putting Washington at risk of not being able to pay its bills.\nThe Treasury came close to missing payments in 2011 and 2013 when Congress delayed increasing the borrowing limit.\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner has left open the possibility of advancing an increase to the debt limit before he resigns from Congress on Oct. 30.\nBut some conservative Republicans have said they cannot support a debt limit increase unless certain issues are addressed, such as a plan to sharply reduce government spending.\nLew told NPR: \"We've made it clear that we are not going to let the debt ceiling be used as a way to extract commitments that otherwise would be unacceptable.\"\nBut he added that the Obama administration has suggested it is open to lawmakers combining the debt limit increase with \"something else that's mutually acceptable\" if that makes passage easier.\nCompleting work on raising the debt limit by the end of October \"is none too early,\" Lew said.\n\"If you just think back to 2013 and 2011, getting to the day before we can't pay our bills, the day before the government of the United States might default for the first time in its history, we shouldn't get even close to it.\"\n(Reporting by Peter Cooney ; Editing by Eric Beech )",

The sooner they act, the better.\"\nThe federal government is currently scraping just under its $18 trillion legal debt cap, with political wrangling over fiscal policy putting Washington at risk of not being able to pay its bills.\nThe Treasury came close to missing payments in 2011 and 2013 when Congress delayed increasing the borrowing limit.\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner has left open the possibility of advancing an increase to the debt limit before he resigns from Congress on Oct. 30.\nBut some conservative Republicans have said they cannot support a debt limit increase unless certain issues are addressed, such as a plan to sharply reduce government spending.\nLew told NPR: \"We've made it clear that we are not going to let the debt ceiling be used as a way to extract commitments that otherwise would be unacceptable.\"\nBut he added that the Obama administration has suggested it is open to lawmakers combining the debt limit increase with \"something else that's mutually acceptable\" if that makes passage easier.\nCompleting work on raising the debt limit by the end of October \"is none too early,\" Lew said.\n\"If you just think back to 2013 and 2011, getting to the day before we can't pay our bills, the day before the government of the United States might default for the first time in its history, we shouldn't get even close to it.\"\n(Reporting by Peter Cooney ; Editing by Eric Beech )",
