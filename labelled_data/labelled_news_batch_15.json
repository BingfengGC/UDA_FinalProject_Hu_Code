Look for better dollar buyers on a move toward 123.20 yen,\" Chandler said in a note. \nThe euro edged down about 0.1 percent to $1.0959. \nAs a spate of solid U.S. economic data has heightened expectations that the U.S. central bank is poised for a hike, speculators increased bullish bets on the greenback to their highest since early June, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday. \nThe value of the dollar's net long position climbed to $32.77 billion in the week ended Aug. 4, from $29.79 billion the previous week. \nThe Swiss franc, meanwhile, was flat from late North American levels, with the dollar buying 0.9833 franc. On Friday, the dollar rose as high as $0.9885, its loftiest peaks since late March. (Editing by Kim Coghill)",

Look for better dollar buyers on a move toward 123.20 yen,\" Chandler said in a note. \nThe euro edged down about 0.1 percent to $1.0959. \nAs a spate of solid U.S. economic data has heightened expectations that the U.S. central bank is poised for a hike, speculators increased bullish bets on the greenback to their highest since early June, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday. \nThe value of the dollar's net long position climbed to $32.77 billion in the week ended Aug. 4, from $29.79 billion the previous week. \nThe Swiss franc, meanwhile, was flat from late North American levels, with the dollar buying 0.9833 franc. On Friday, the dollar rose as high as $0.9885, its loftiest peaks since late March. (Editing by Kim Coghill)",

        "text": "(Adds comment by mayor, background on city's fiscal woes, budget process and pension payments)\nCHICAGO, July 31 (Reuters) - Budget deficits are projected to persist for Chicago as pension and debt costs gobble up more revenue, according to an annual financial analysis released by the city on Friday.\nWhile the report projects that fiscal 2016 expenditures will outstrip revenue by $232.6 million, the lowest gap since 2008, additional pension and debt payments would push the deficit to $425.6 million.\nIf Illinois fails to enact legislation easing Chicago's payments to its public safety retirement systems, the deficit could be even higher.\n\"We have made significant progress, while continuing to make investments important to Chicago's families and neighborhoods, but this progress is threatened by the massive pension liabilities that must be addressed this year,\" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement.\nThe analysis indicated that budget gaps would continue through fiscal 2018, when the deficit could range from $132.4 million to $801 million.\nChronic structural budget deficits and a $20 billion unfunded pension liability have led to a slew of credit rating downgrades, including one by Moody's Investors Service in May that dropped Chicago into the \"junk\" category. As a result, the third-largest U.S. city has had to offer hefty yields to sell its debt in the municipal bond market.\nEmanuel has said he will speed up the budget process for fiscal 2016, which begins on Jan. 1, by unveiling his spending plan in September instead of October.\nThe city has not revealed how it plans to increase its contribution to pensions for public safety workers, as mandated by a 2010 Illinois law, if the payment restructuring bill does not become law. The bill passed by lawmakers in May would reduce the total payment by $220 million to $619 million from $839 million. The city's payments would increase every year from 2017 to 2020 but not as much as under the 2010 law.\n(Reporting by Karen Pierog ; Editing by Matthew Lewis )",

Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro declined to comment.

They can buy online at nsandi.com or by phoning 0500 007 007 at any time of day or night. \nAlternatively they can apply by post by completing an application form that can be requested by phoning the above number, or downloaded from the website and returning the form to NS&I. \nExisting bond holders can buy more by making a direct transfer from their bank account as long as they have their 'premium bond holder's number' to hand. \nNatural step Jane Platt, chief executive at NS&I, said: \"The majority of our customers already use direct channels to buy their Premium Bonds, and so moving to 100% direct sales is a natural next step for NS&I.\" She added: \"After such a long-standing relationship we know it's important that we help our customers with the transition. We'll be writing to those who have recently bought Premium Bonds through the Post Office to let them know about the end date on counter sales and to assist them with using our direct channels for purchases from 1 August.\" NS&I explained that the move was part of its contribution to help reducing the cost to the taxpayer of government borrowing. \nIn a statement, the National Federation of Subpostmasters said: \"This is very disappointing news, particularly for our elderly and more vulnerable customers who rely on face-to-face support from subpostmasters with handling these types of transactions.\" Earlier this month, the maximum amount that can be invested in premium bonds rose from £40,000 to £50,000, meaning the limit has risen by £20,000 in little over a year. \nOnly one year ago was the former upper limit of £30,000 increased to £40,000, at which point a second £1 million prize was also introduced.",

However, the market tremors over the past week have been felt by people in the UK and we have seen a clear drop-off in confidence as a result,\" Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov Reports said. \nGlobal share markets were hit this week by worries that the Chinese economy, the most important engine for the world economy, was growing at a much slower pace than Beijing's 7 percent target for 2015.

However, the market tremors over the past week have been felt by people in the UK and we have seen a clear drop-off in confidence as a result,\" Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov Reports said. \nGlobal share markets were hit this week by worries that the Chinese economy, the most important engine for the world economy, was growing at a much slower pace than Beijing's 7 percent target for 2015.

I learned there are different types of companies,\" he said. \nAsked about future partnerships with Volkswagen, he said \"you will not remarry someone you have divorced with,\" adding the company will focus on \"surviving independently.\" \nSuzuki planned to seek support from Volkswagen in hybrid technologies and other eco-friendly areas, while the German firm hoped to jointly develop small cars for emerging markets by taking advantage of Suzuki's know-how. \nBut they made little progress and halted their joint projects. \nThe Japanese automaker in 2011 said it wanted to end the alliance, citing a deep disagreement over collaboration and complained that its partner failed to provide promised access to technologies. \nSuzuki demanded Volkswagen sell back its stake in the Japanese carmaker by November 2012. \nAhead of Suzuki's move towards ending the tie-up, relations had become frayed as Volkswagen served notice of an alleged infringement relating to the supply of diesel engines to Suzuki from Italian carmaker Fiat (Hanover: FIA1.HA - news ) .",

Learn more... \nSun, Aug 30, 2015, 13:36 BST - UK Markets closed Suzuki to buy back shares as Volkswagen row settled AFP – 46 minutes ago View Photo \n\nJapan's Suzuki Motor said on Sunday it plans to buy back its shares sold to Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) after an international arbitration court settled a dispute between the two automakers. \nThe ruling came four years after the Japanese small car maker attempted to end an alliance with the German auto giant, which has refused Suzuki's repeated demands to sell back the 112.21 million shares, or 19.9 percent of Suzuki. \nArbitrators at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ruled the alliance has been terminated and ordered Volkswagen to dispose of Suzuki shares, the Japanese company said. \nChairman Osamu Suzuki said at a press conference held in Tokyo on Sunday he \"feels really good\" and is \"satisfied\" with the decision from arbitrators. \nThe chairman did not elaborate on why the two automakers had to split after a 1.7 million euro ($2.3 billion) tie-up in 2009. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was a precious experience. I learned there are different types of companies,\" he said. \nAsked about future partnerships with Volkswagen, he said \"you will not remarry someone you have divorced with,\" adding the company will focus on \"surviving independently.\" \nSuzuki planned to seek support from Volkswagen in hybrid technologies and other eco-friendly areas, while the German firm hoped to jointly develop small cars for emerging markets by taking advantage of Suzuki's know-how. \nBut they made little progress and halted their joint projects. \nThe Japanese automaker in 2011 said it wanted to end the alliance, citing a deep disagreement over collaboration and complained that its partner failed to provide promised access to technologies. \nSuzuki demanded Volkswagen sell back its stake in the Japanese carmaker by November 2012. \nAhead of Suzuki's move towards ending the tie-up, relations had become frayed as Volkswagen served notice of an alleged infringement relating to the supply of diesel engines to Suzuki from Italian carmaker Fiat (Hanover: FIA1.HA - news ) .",

(AP) -- A chemical commonly used at commercial car and truck washes can be dangerous to workers, according to new research by the Washington Department of Labor and Industries. \nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report Friday based on research from the agency, which looked at workers' compensation injury reports from 2001 to 2013. It found 48 workers suffered burns from hydrofluoric-acid-based car wash products, and one, a 38-year-old man, died after ingesting some — though it wasn't clear if the ingestion was intentional. \nHydrofluoric acid is often used in car wash products to brighten aluminum and break down road grime. The workers injured typically suffered burns to their hands, head or eyes, sometimes because they had holes in their gloves or failed to wear them at all. Seven needed to be hospitalized, three suffered third-degree burns, and two needed surgery, including skin grafts. \n\"Hydrofluoric acid is insidiously toxic at the low concentrations used in vehicle washing,\" Carolyn Whitaker, one of the researchers, said in a news release. \"Initially, when it touches the skin there may be little or no pain. That means workers are often unaware of the burn until later and typically delay getting treatment.\" \nThat's what happened to one of the badly burned workers. He splashed his left leg while transferring a cleaning solution between containers, didn't wash the substance off and continued to work for about 90 minutes — with his pants and shoe soaked — before he noticed the burning sensation, the report said. \nEmergency medical technicians treated him and brought him to a burn unit, but he needed a skin graft for the third-degree burns and eventually received permanent partial disability payments due to chronic numbness in the foot. \nWhitaker and the department said commercial car and truck washes should use alternative products that do not include hydrofluoric acid, and when it is used, workplaces should take steps to minimize exposure, make sure employees are trained and fully aware of the serious hazard, and make sure they wear protective gear. \nThe chemical is also used in wheel- and boat-brightening products sold for home use, and even low concentrations can be hazardous, Labor and Industries said. The agency recommended that people use alternatives.",

        "text": "CHICAGO Aug 31 The Chicago Public Schools' recently approved $5.7 billion budget is structurally out of balance and could weaken the district's already low credit standing, Moody's Investors Service said on Monday.\nThe nation's third-largest public school system has a \"junk\" rating of Ba3 with Moody's, which said the budget constitutes a negative credit factor for the district.\nThe budget, unanimously approved by the Chicago Board of Education last Wednesday, relies on nearly $400 million in nonrecurring revenue gained through debt restructuring and tapping reserves or surpluses, and $480 million in assumed, but uncertain monetary aid from the state of Illinois, the rating agency said.\nIn addition, the fiscal 2016 spending plan \"optimistically assumes no salary increases\" for teachers, whose contract expired on June 30, according to Moody's.\n\"With salaries and benefits close to 70 percent of general operating fund expenditures, any personnel-related increases that result from contract negotiations would exacerbate the district's operating pressures,\" Moody's said.\nThe school system, which has more than $6 billion of debt outstanding, plans to sell up to $1.04 billion of general obligation bonds.

Regional authorities had sold 1.4 trillion yuan of the bonds as of the end of July, Lou said. The nation announced a first batch of 1 trillion yuan in March and a second allotment of the same amount in June. Xinhua didn’t specifically give the size of the third increase.\n“The plan will improve local governments’ fiscal strength and accelerate the implementation of investment projects, but it won’t reverse the downward trend of China’s economy in near-term,” said Liu Dongliang, a Shenzhen-based analyst at China Merchants Bank Co. Expansion of investment may worsen China’s industrial overcapacity and external demand will continue to weaken, Liu said.\nThe People’s Bank of China on Tuesday cut interest rates for a fifth time since November and reduced the amount of cash that lenders need to set aside as reserves. Premier Li Keqiang is seeking to defend a 7 percent economic growth goal at the same time as trying to keep local-government debt under control. The pool of regional liabilities has swelled to 25 trillion yuan, bigger than Germany’s economy, Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. estimates.\nRegional authorities should “offer necessary support” to their financing arms, whose businesses should be restructured, Xinhua said on Thursday, citing Lou.\nChina’s local governments have 1.86 trillion yuan of debt that matures in 2015, as well as an additional 919.3 billion yuan in contingent liabilities, according to a government audit report based on data as of June 2013.\n“This move will add supply in the bond market, and may cause the yield to increase,” Merchant Bank’s Liu said. “The PBOC needs to continue to cut reserve-requirement ratio or supply cash in targeted ways.”",

Hillhouse was also not an investor, said a third source who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject. \nA spokeswoman for Uber declined to comment. \nWith the close of the $1 billion round, Uber is re-lining its war chest for a drawn-out battle with Chinese car-hailing app rival Didi Kuaidi, which last month raised $2 billion. \nThe two are locked in a turf war, spending heavily on subsidies to lower the cost for users and inflate the money earned for drivers of their services. \nThe deal was oversubscribed, said the second source directly familiar with the fundraising.

The move comes after the company previously announced about 270 layoffs for Illinois employees.\n\"The restructuring is a result of a consolidation of several divisions combined with current business conditions,\" spokeswoman Lisa Miller said in a written statement.\nCaterpillar has let go about 4,800 employees over the past year and has cut 20,000 full-time employees worldwide since 2012, more than 10 percent of its global workforce.\nThe most recent layoffs will primarily affect employees at facilities around central Illinois, including Peoria and Morton, but will also include some global positions, Miller said.\nThe positions were responsible for supporting after-market parts and service and handling customer and dealer support, Miller said.\nThe layoffs are expected to take effect on various dates and some may not be effective for several months. The impacted workers are office personnel and are not union-represented employees.\nIn July, the company reported a drop in quarterly profit due to an expected decline in construction revenue on reduced residential building activity in China and Brazil, soft sales related to oil and gas construction in the United States and the strong U.S. dollar undercutting the value of sales in Europe.

Volumes were likely to be thin with UK markets closed for a public holiday. \nThe Euro STOXX 50, the DAX and the CAC, all down about 9 percent in August so far, were set to record their worst monthly performance in percentage terms in four years. \nThe Fed left open on Friday the possibility of a September interest rate increase, although several officials at the U.S. central bank acknowledged that prolonged turmoil in financial markets might delay the first policy tightening in nearly a decade. \nShanghai stocks, which have plunged more than 40 percent since mid-June, were down about 1 percent, while MSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) 's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.4 percent and was on track for a fall of about 10 percent this month.

Flows through the SEGAL pipeline are expected to return on Friday. \nFurther along the curve, gas for September delivery was up 0.40 pence at 39.35 p/therm. \nPrices were also slightly higher on the Dutch TTF market, with gas for day-ahead delivery up 0.08 euro at 18.98 euros per megawatt-hour. \nIn Europe's carbon market, benchmark EU Allowances (EUA) was down by 0.02 euros to 8.09 euros a tonne.

Flows through the SEGAL pipeline are expected to return on Friday. \nFurther along the curve, gas for September delivery was up 0.40 pence at 39.35 p/therm. \nPrices were also slightly higher on the Dutch TTF market, with gas for day-ahead delivery up 0.08 euro at 18.98 euros per megawatt-hour. \nIn Europe's carbon market, benchmark EU Allowances (EUA) was down by 0.02 euros to 8.09 euros a tonne.

Typically, the company launches upgraded versions to existing phones under the \"S\" range. \nMedia reports have indicated that Apple is preparing for the largest initial production run for its next iPhones by the end of the year. \nThe new iPhones are also said to feature Force Touch technology, which can distinguish between a light tap and deep press. \nCross Research analyst Shannon Cross said she was also expecting a faster processor on iPhones. \n\"We assume that they may come out with a new iPad at the event as well,\" Cross added. \nWhen users posed the question in the invitation to Siri on their iPhones, Siri threw back responses such as \"You're cute when you're desperate for information\" and \"You'll have to wait until Sept. 9. I bet you were one of those kids who snuck downstairs to open presents early, weren't you?\" \nThe event will be held at 10:00 a.m. PT in the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, which can hold about 7,000 people. \nApple did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the event. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan, Peter Henderson and Julia Love; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

Learn more... \nThu, Aug 27, 2015, 21:42 BST - UK Markets closed Apple lines up Sept. 9 event, seen unveiling new iPhones Reuters – 2 hours 57 minutes ago View Photo \nCustomers stand beneath an Apple logo at the Apple store in Grand Central station in New York City, July … \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Thursday invited journalists to a Sept. 9 event, where it is expected to unveil new iPhones and potentially a new version of its Apple TV set-top box. \nThe email invitation includes a colorful Apple logo with the sentence \"Hey Siri, give us a hint,\" referring to Apple's popular digital voice assistant. \nThe company traditionally announces its new iPhones in September. \nApple is widely expected to unveil the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6 Plus S. Typically, the company launches upgraded versions to existing phones under the \"S\" range. \nMedia reports have indicated that Apple is preparing for the largest initial production run for its next iPhones by the end of the year. \nThe new iPhones are also said to feature Force Touch technology, which can distinguish between a light tap and deep press. \nCross Research analyst Shannon Cross said she was also expecting a faster processor on iPhones. \n\"We assume that they may come out with a new iPad at the event as well,\" Cross added. \nWhen users posed the question in the invitation to Siri on their iPhones, Siri threw back responses such as \"You're cute when you're desperate for information\" and \"You'll have to wait until Sept. 9. I bet you were one of those kids who snuck downstairs to open presents early, weren't you?\" \nThe event will be held at 10:00 a.m. PT in the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, which can hold about 7,000 people. \nApple did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the event. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan, Peter Henderson and Julia Love; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

Aug 29 U.S. inflation will likely rise as the dollar and other influences fade, and the Federal Reserve can probably raise rates gradually, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said on Saturday.\n\"Given the apparent stability of inflation expectations, there is good reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the forces holding down inflation dissipate further,\" he told a central bankers' conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\"With inflation low, we can probably remove accommodation at a gradual pace,\" he added. \"Yet, because monetary policy influences real activity with a substantial lag, we should not wait until inflation is back to 2 percent to begin tightening.\" (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer and Howard Schneider ; Editing by Andrea Ricci )",

But Brilinta has shown additional benefits and AstraZeneca is working to ramp up its use. \nFollowing the success of the PEGASUS trial, the British drugmaker is hoping for U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Food and Drug Administration approval for extended use of Brilinta as early as next week. \nGiving Brilinta to patients who had a heart attack over a year ago could more than double the number of people eligible for the medicine. \nGrowing Brilinta is a top priority for AstraZeneca, which has forecast that annual sales of the drug could reach $3.5 billion by 2023. \nThe new ESC guidelines, announced at the organisation's annual meeting in London, also allow for shortened dual drug use of just three to six months, if patients are at high risk of bleeding, as well as extended use up to 30 months. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Mark Heinrich)",

But Brilinta has shown additional benefits and AstraZeneca is working to ramp up its use. \nFollowing the success of the PEGASUS trial, the British drugmaker is hoping for U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Food and Drug Administration approval for extended use of Brilinta as early as next week. \nGiving Brilinta to patients who had a heart attack over a year ago could more than double the number of people eligible for the medicine. \nGrowing Brilinta is a top priority for AstraZeneca, which has forecast that annual sales of the drug could reach $3.5 billion by 2023. \nThe new ESC guidelines, announced at the organisation's annual meeting in London, also allow for shortened dual drug use of just three to six months, if patients are at high risk of bleeding, as well as extended use up to 30 months. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Mark Heinrich)",

At least fifteen of the 30 largest equity markets among emerging economies have extended losses from their peaks to 20 percent or more, fulfilling traders’ definition of a bear market.

Chinese policy makers could use monetary and fiscal policies, including easing banks’ reserve requirements, to boost equities, he said.\n“If regulators allow banks to put money into markets, then there’s quite a message,” Mobius said.\nChina cut interest rates for the fifth time since November and lowered the amount of cash banks must set aside hours after its stock market closed on Tuesday. The one-year lending rate will drop by 25 basis points to 4.6 percent, while the required reserve ratio will be lowered by 50 basis points for all banks to cover liquidity gaps, the central bank said.\nEconomic Concerns The Shanghai Composite Index sank 7.6 percent on Tuesday, extending its worst four-day loss since 1996, amid concern policy makers have abandoned market support measures.\nChina’s shock devaluation of the yuan this month has sent convulsions through financial markets, fueling speculation that the slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy may be deeper than previously thought. The rout has driven gauges of volatility to multi-year highs and sent bond yields tumbling as investors wound back bets that the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest-rates as soon as next month.\n“People are so pessimistic and so much money has been withdrawn that sellers are forced to sell,” Mobius said. “Don’t get excited, take a few days off, wait for the market to stabilize, then come in.”",

        "text": "The central banker&apos;s task of keeping inflation just right has become a permanent tussle with the global currency markets. Too weak a currency equals too rapid price gains. Too strong, and disinflation looms.\nThat&apos;s the well-worn argument under the microscope Friday at the Jackson Hole Symposium, the U.S. Federal Reserve&apos;s annual policy getaway. Gita Gopinath, a scholar at Harvard University, says that it just isn&apos;t that simple.\n\"The greater the fraction of a country&apos;s imports invoiced in a foreign currency, the greater its inflation sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations at both short and long horizons,&apos;&apos; she says. Because the dollar is by far the dominant currency in world trade, \"U.S. inflation is consequently more insulated from exchange rate shocks, while other countries are highly sensitive to it.&apos;&apos;\nHer work in this area been cited by the European Central Bank, the prime example of an institution hoping that a weaker currency will spur inflation.\nHere&apos;s what Gopinath&apos;s research means for ECB Governing Council members: since Ireland has to pay for more of its imports in a foreign currency than France, a weaker euro will have a much bigger inflationary impact on Irish consumer prices than French. Officials, who will make their next policy decision on Thursday in Frankfurt, are struggling to end a bout of near-stagnant price growth.\nThere&apos;s another implication, this time of interest to Fed watchers, for whom the question of a September rate increase has become more uncertain. It&apos;s that the dominance of the U.S. dollar insulates the world&apos;s largest economy from a major price impact through currency swings.\nSo how does that play out for the monetary guardians gathered at Jackson Hole? The greenback has gained against all but one of its Group of 10 peers this year.\n\"There&apos;s a lot of talk about the dollar appreciation and the consequences of that for inflation,&apos;&apos; Gopinath told her audience on Friday. \"What all of this evidence basically tells you is these effects are going to be small. This is not a major impact for a country like the U.S.\"",

        "text_full": "A Currency Drop is Inflationary, Right?\nThe central banker&apos;s task of keeping inflation just right has become a permanent tussle with the global currency markets. Too weak a currency equals too rapid price gains. Too strong, and disinflation looms.\nThat&apos;s the well-worn argument under the microscope Friday at the Jackson Hole Symposium, the U.S. Federal Reserve&apos;s annual policy getaway. Gita Gopinath, a scholar at Harvard University, says that it just isn&apos;t that simple.\n\"The greater the fraction of a country&apos;s imports invoiced in a foreign currency, the greater its inflation sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations at both short and long horizons,&apos;&apos; she says. Because the dollar is by far the dominant currency in world trade, \"U.S. inflation is consequently more insulated from exchange rate shocks, while other countries are highly sensitive to it.&apos;&apos;\nHer work in this area been cited by the European Central Bank, the prime example of an institution hoping that a weaker currency will spur inflation.\nHere&apos;s what Gopinath&apos;s research means for ECB Governing Council members: since Ireland has to pay for more of its imports in a foreign currency than France, a weaker euro will have a much bigger inflationary impact on Irish consumer prices than French. Officials, who will make their next policy decision on Thursday in Frankfurt, are struggling to end a bout of near-stagnant price growth.\nThere&apos;s another implication, this time of interest to Fed watchers, for whom the question of a September rate increase has become more uncertain. It&apos;s that the dominance of the U.S. dollar insulates the world&apos;s largest economy from a major price impact through currency swings.\nSo how does that play out for the monetary guardians gathered at Jackson Hole? The greenback has gained against all but one of its Group of 10 peers this year.\n\"There&apos;s a lot of talk about the dollar appreciation and the consequences of that for inflation,&apos;&apos; Gopinath told her audience on Friday. \"What all of this evidence basically tells you is these effects are going to be small. This is not a major impact for a country like the U.S.\"",

An Internet-based startup boom in the country has also seen increased adaptability on smartphones, bolstering the demand for high-speed data. \n4G services typically make it much faster than 3G services to surf the web on mobile phones, tablets and laptops. \n(Reporting by Nivedita Bhattacharjee in Mumbai; Editing by Anand Basu)",
