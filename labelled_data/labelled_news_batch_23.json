AB InBev’s mooted £68bn takeover of SAB , announced on Tuesday, is almost certainly going to require the disposal of the London-listed company’s interest in the venture because of expected regulatory concerns about competition. \nMolson Coors is the obvious buyer of the stake. An acquisition of SAB a so-called change of control - automatically gives Molson Coors the right to lift its interest in the joint venture to 50pc and name a chief executive of the business. It then also has first and last refusal over buying out the remaining 50pc. \nAB InBev and SAB have struck an “agreement in principle” for what would be Britain’s biggest ever takeover . The Belgian-Brazilian brewer behind Budweiser and Stella Artois has until October 28 to make a formal offer for SAB. \nSpokesmen for AB InBev and SAB declined to comment. Molson Coors did not return requests for comment.",

AB InBev’s mooted £68bn takeover of SAB , announced on Tuesday, is almost certainly going to require the disposal of the London-listed company’s interest in the venture because of expected regulatory concerns about competition. \nMolson Coors is the obvious buyer of the stake. An acquisition of SAB a so-called change of control - automatically gives Molson Coors the right to lift its interest in the joint venture to 50pc and name a chief executive of the business. It then also has first and last refusal over buying out the remaining 50pc. \nAB InBev and SAB have struck an “agreement in principle” for what would be Britain’s biggest ever takeover . The Belgian-Brazilian brewer behind Budweiser and Stella Artois has until October 28 to make a formal offer for SAB. \nSpokesmen for AB InBev and SAB declined to comment. Molson Coors did not return requests for comment.",

The NRF said online retail sales could increase up to 8 percent, to as much as $105 billion.\nFedEx said that it expects to see three spikes in package volumes during peak season, on Cyber Monday and the first two Mondays in December. The company said its holiday projections are included in its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings guidance of between $10.40 and $10.90 per share.\nThe rapid rise of ecommerce poses challenges for retailers and package delivery companies alike. In 2013 bad weather and a late surge in online retail packages caught FedEx and main rival United Parcel Service Inc off guard, leaving an estimated 2 million packages undelivered on Christmas Eve, the majority in UPS' network.\nLast year both companies touted investments in their networks and close collaboration with major retailers to manage package flows during the holidays. UPS ended up over-spending to prepare for package volume spikes that did not materialize, hurting its fourth-quarter earnings. FedEx did not report any problems.\nThis year FedEx has invested $1.6 billion in capacity and automation projects at FedEx Ground to help with peak season.\nFedEx's Fitzgerald said that if retailers come in way above forecast with a sudden surge in packages, the company may \"need to cap volumes\" in order to protect its network.

However, if the union's negotiators believe there is progress toward an agreement, the deadline can be postponed.\nGM and the union have been in talks since July and have for the last several days intensified negotiations to reach a deal.

It has been criticised by politicians, investors and consumers for the time it is taking to produce answers.\nThe KBA and other European national authorities are due to provide an update to the European Commission in Brussels later on Thursday on investigations of the emissions scandal in their respective markets.\nAlso, Germany's transport ministry, which has in the past said about 2.8 million cars in Germany were affected, said Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt would make a statement on Volkswagen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT).

It has been criticised by politicians, investors and consumers for the time it is taking to produce answers.\nThe KBA and other European national authorities are due to provide an update to the European Commission in Brussels later on Thursday on investigations of the emissions scandal in their respective markets.\nAlso, Germany's transport ministry, which has in the past said about 2.8 million cars in Germany were affected, said Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt would make a statement on Volkswagen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT).

The average estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for 858 million francs. The investment bank posted a pretax loss of 125 million francs.\nChief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam, brought in to rebuild investor confidence, is seeking to boost returns under pressure from tougher capital requirements and record-low interest rates. A market rout over the summer ensnared assets from junk bonds to emerging-market currencies, denting results at U.S. banks.\nIn a separate announcement on Wednesday, Credit Suisse said it planned to increase capital by about 6.05 billion francs, including a rights offering and a private placing. It also outlined plans for 3.5 billion francs of cost savings by the end of 2018 and other strategic measures.\nCredit Suisse’s investment bank pretax loss missed an estimate for a pretax profit of 308 million francs for the third quarter. Revenue from underwriting and advisory declined 30 percent to 635 million francs.\nNet revenue from fixed-income sales and trading plunged 52 percent to 674 million francs as “extreme dislocations” in credit markets resulted in lower client activity, according to a company presentation. Equity sales and trading gained 8.8 percent to 1.17 billion francs.\nPrivate banking and wealth management posted 647 million francs in pretax profit, down 31 percent, Credit Suisse said. The wealth-management client business, the biggest part of the division, posted pretax profit of 477 million francs, down 11 percent.\nCredit Suisse saw a “significant decline” in emerging markets compared with the third quarter of 2014 due to subdued client financing volumes and trading activity, according to the presentation.",

Especially strong demand from first-time buyers has seen the price of properties bought by those getting on the housing ladder jump by close to 10pc in the period. \nMiles Shipside, a Rightmove housing analyst, said that the growth in average house prices was “mainly being fuelled by the heady price rises of typical first-time-buyer homes”. \n“Despite tighter lending criteria in last year’s Mortgage Market Review , some first-time buyers can still afford the higher prices being asked for by sellers,” he said. \nRightmove said that the higher costs faced by first-time buyers were symptomatic of a shortage of small properties, and increased demand from buy-to-let landlords investing in response to a significant need for rented accommodation. \nCompetition between budding first-time home purchasers and landlords had created a “vicious circle”, the property website said. Housing scarcity has made it increasingly costly to live, either by owning or renting a home. \nMany letting agents reported a high volume of “same day” rentals, as available properties were quickly snapped up, as there is little or no property available to rent. Rightmove said that a growing number are attracted to the “transience” of renting , without the commitment and hassle of buying and selling a property. \n“With local authorities, housing associations and developers no longer satisfying the country’s housing needs, those in particular looking to rent or buy smaller homes must hope for the cavalry to come to their rescue,” said Mr Shipside. \n“In the meantime, it seems the army of privateer buy-to-let investors remains the only short to medium term way to scale up our rental capacity.”",

Especially strong demand from first-time buyers has seen the price of properties bought by those getting on the housing ladder jump by close to 10pc in the period. \nMiles Shipside, a Rightmove housing analyst, said that the growth in average house prices was “mainly being fuelled by the heady price rises of typical first-time-buyer homes”. \n“Despite tighter lending criteria in last year’s Mortgage Market Review , some first-time buyers can still afford the higher prices being asked for by sellers,” he said. \nRightmove said that the higher costs faced by first-time buyers were symptomatic of a shortage of small properties, and increased demand from buy-to-let landlords investing in response to a significant need for rented accommodation. \nCompetition between budding first-time home purchasers and landlords had created a “vicious circle”, the property website said. Housing scarcity has made it increasingly costly to live, either by owning or renting a home. \nMany letting agents reported a high volume of “same day” rentals, as available properties were quickly snapped up, as there is little or no property available to rent. Rightmove said that a growing number are attracted to the “transience” of renting , without the commitment and hassle of buying and selling a property. \n“With local authorities, housing associations and developers no longer satisfying the country’s housing needs, those in particular looking to rent or buy smaller homes must hope for the cavalry to come to their rescue,” said Mr Shipside. \n“In the meantime, it seems the army of privateer buy-to-let investors remains the only short to medium term way to scale up our rental capacity.”",

The two containers of waste came from the company's reprocessing plant in Beaumont-Hague, near Cherbourg.",

The two containers of waste came from the company's reprocessing plant in Beaumont-Hague, near Cherbourg.",

Global equities snapped their longest rally since February on Tuesday and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell from a seven-week high amid a plunge in Chinese imports.

A softer read on the Chinese inflation data reinforces the backdrop of deflationary pressures and a softer growth profile globally.

He was fired from the post later that year after he came under investigation.

The conversations are the first Puerto Rico officials have held with holders of the government’s debt since the territory’s leadership released a restructuring and economic plan that would seek to cut government services and force losses on most creditors.\nThe development bank is closely tied to other government borrowers because it acts as a lender to the commonwealth and its localities. The GDB has been working with Citigroup Inc. to help oversee its financial restructuring.\n“In order to maintain the integrity of this process, we have no plans to publicize the nature of any of our conversations with our creditors,” said Barbara Morgan , a spokeswoman for the GDB at SKDKnickerbocker in New York. Scott Helfman, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup, declined to comment.\nThe group is advised by law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and financial advisory firm Ducera Partners, people with knowledge of the matter said in July. Adam Verost, a representative for Ducera, and Susan Peters, a spokeswoman for Davis Polk, didn’t immediately respond to telephone and e-mail messages.",

The conversations are the first Puerto Rico officials have held with holders of the government’s debt since the territory’s leadership released a restructuring and economic plan that would seek to cut government services and force losses on most creditors.\nThe development bank is closely tied to other government borrowers because it acts as a lender to the commonwealth and its localities. The GDB has been working with Citigroup Inc. to help oversee its financial restructuring.\n“In order to maintain the integrity of this process, we have no plans to publicize the nature of any of our conversations with our creditors,” said Barbara Morgan , a spokeswoman for the GDB at SKDKnickerbocker in New York. Scott Helfman, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup, declined to comment.\nThe group is advised by law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and financial advisory firm Ducera Partners, people with knowledge of the matter said in July. Adam Verost, a representative for Ducera, and Susan Peters, a spokeswoman for Davis Polk, didn’t immediately respond to telephone and e-mail messages.",

Some of the measures put in place to protect markets after the 2010 flash crash should be revisited, he said in a briefing with reporters in New York on Thursday.\n\"What we learned five years ago needs to be iterated, clearly,\" said Khandros. \"August 24 was a lesson that for flash crash safeguards, perhaps an update is in order.\"\nRules created in response to the 2010 volatility have been blamed for contributing to the chaos on that day, when $1.2 trillion of U.S. market value was erased before prices partially recovered. The price bands that trigger halts in trading, for instance, were seen as exacerbating volatility, he said.\nSince Aug. 24, some of the world’s largest issuers of ETFs, including BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp., have held talks with stock exchanges on potential solutions to the structural problems that plagued markets that day, Bloomberg News reported last week.\nBlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, also released its own proposals on many of the same issues that Khandros said his clients raised. The firm proposed several changes, including thresholds for market-wide circuit breakers and altering the limits for volatility curbs to help stave off a repeat. BlackRock also suggested tighter alignment of the rules governing the equities and futures markets, an issue Khandros said UBS clients also repeatedly raised.",

This has led to a decline in the diesel generator market in Europe. The diesel portable generator market is facing competition from gas generators, fuel cells, and biofuel-based equipment. \nAccording to the report, the industrial sector is a major end-user of stationary gas generators. Many industrial units, factories, plants, and manufacturing facilities use stationary gas generators. Continuous disruptions in electricity supply have forced industrial users to install high power rated stationary gas generators for uninterrupted electricity supply. Owing to the huge dip in natural gas prices, industrial users have shifted their focus to stationary gas generators. These gas generators help industrial users comply with emission standards. \nFurther, the report states that one of the challenges hindering the market growth is many end-users of generators, including the residential segment, are looking at alternative forms of energy rather than depending only on generators. \nThe report includes the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global stationary gas generator market for 2015-2019. The market can be segmented into three divisions on the basis of product range: less than 60 kW, 61-1,000 kW, and above 1,000 kW stationary gas generators. In addition, the report includes the segmentation of the global stationary gas generator market on the basis of geography. \nKey vendors",

        "text": "WASHINGTON Oct 12 Lockheed Martin Corp delivered only three of 44 interceptors for the THAAD missile defense system in fiscal year 2015 due to a seven-month halt in production caused by computer issues, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said.\nThe interceptors for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense program, which has an average budget of $800 million a year, are now expected to be delivered by September 2016, Rick Lehner, spokesman for the agency, said in an email to Reuters.\nSuch glitches typically result in lower award or incentive fees for contractors, but Lehner had no immediate comment on whether Lockheed's fees would be reduced.\nLockheed, the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, declined to comment on the financial impact of the delayed deliveries.\nTHAAD provides the U.S. military a land-based, mobile capability to defend against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, intercepting incoming missiles inside and outside the earth's atmosphere. Each launcher uses eight interceptors.\nLockheed spokeswoman Cheryl Amerine said the computer issue had been resolved and the revised delivery plan was met in June.\n\"Interceptor deliveries were delayed to allow time for a requested upgrade that further improved the mission computer and interceptor's performance,\" she said.\nThe program halted production of interceptors during missile segment testing after the mission computer's Static Random Access Memory - a new device on the computer's memory card - failed an acceptance procedure, Army Colonel Anthony Brown, THAAD program manager, said in a report released last week.\nAs of March, when that report was completed, the program had projected that Lockheed would deliver nine interceptors in the 2015 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. But Lehner said only three were actually delivered.\nBrown said budget cuts also posed problems for the program, with funding for THAAD interceptors cut from 72 a year in fiscal 2011 to around 18 a year in fiscal 2017 and 2018, and 17 a year in 2019 and 2020.\nAs a result, the U.S. Army was unlikely to achieve its goal of receiving a full combat load of interceptors for a seventh unit and a preliminary load for an eighth unit by fiscal 2020, unless costs could be lowered by bundling orders, Brown said.\nHis report was part of the Pentagon's third annual report on the performance of its weapons acquisition system.",

It is not known where Munoz is being treated.\nUnited acknowledged in a short statement on Friday that Munoz's family informed the company he had been hospitalized the day before, and said it would provide \"further details as appropriate.\" A person familiar with the matter confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack.\nUnited has an obligation to disclose material developments, wrote John Coffee, a professor specializing in corporate governance issues at Columbia University's law school, in an email. \"It is the obligation of the company to keep the market informed of material developments and this seems clearly material to me,\" Coffee wrote.\nIt is puzzling why the company has not stated who will take over for Munoz in the meantime, said Greg Taxin, chief investment officer of New York-based Luma Asset Management, and founder of corporate governance research firm Glass, Lewis & Co.\n\"It's probably silly or foolish that they just haven't satisfied people's desire to know how the chain of command is working,\" Taxin said. \"On the other hand, I presume the CEO of United Airlines goes on vacation on a regular basis, and he's not around to answer question or make decision and things run just fine.\"\nUnited's previous chief executive left while federal authorities were conducting an investigation involving the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\nMunoz had made it a priority to tackle complaints by customers and employees of United Continental in recent years, often related to the company's struggles to merge the operations of the former United and Continental airlines.

That offering was five times oversubscribed and proceeds partly refinanced 54 billion pesos of similar securities due that month.\nThe Philippines’ peso is expected to weaken 3 percent to 47.20 a dollar by the end of the year from Monday’s close of 45.80, according to a median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The currency has depreciated 2.7 percent since Dec. 31, making it more expensive for companies in the Southeast Asian nation to service their dollar-denominated debt.\nThat’s put pressure on San Miguel’s earnings, even amid gains from its oil refining and beer and liquor businesses. Profit in the first half fell 8 percent from a year earlier, the company said in August. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements, recurring profit rose 15 percent.\nSan Miguel has some $13 billion equivalent of bonds and loans outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of that, U.S. currency notes total $6.8 billion, with a weighted average fixed coupon of 5 percent.\nThe company is seeking to at least double its revenue over the next five years to between $40 billion and $50 billion, via both acquisitions and organic growth, Ang told reporters in Manila last month. Its stock has slumped 35.3 percent this year versus a 1.9 percent decrease in the country’s benchmark stock index.",

Learn more... \nSat, Oct 17, 2015, 10:11 BST - UK Markets closed China's Premier Li says achieving growth of around 7 percent 'not easy' Reuters – 8 minutes ago Print \nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Premier Li Keqiang said that with the global economic recovery losing steam, achieving domestic growth of around 7 percent is \"not easy\", according to a transcript of his remarks posted on the website of the State Council, China's cabinet. \nNonetheless in his comments, made at a recent meeting with senior provincial officials, the premier said that continued strength in the labour market and services were reasons for optimism, despite the headwinds facing the manufacturing sector. \n\"As long as employment remains adequate, the people's income grows, and the environment continuously improves, GDP a little higher or lower than 7 percent is acceptable,\" the premier said in the comments posted on Saturday. \nChina is due to release its third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth figures on Monday. A Reuters poll of 50 economists put expected growth at 6.8 percent year on year, which would be the slowest since the financial crisis in 2009. \nChina's growth in the first half of 2015, at 7 percent, was already the slowest since that time. Policymakers had previously forecast growth of \"around 7 percent\" for 2015. \nMost official and private estimates show that the Chinese labour market as a whole is outperforming the steep slowdown in industry, largely due to continuing strength in the service sector. \nBut some analysts have expressed concern that the sharp drop in industrial profits over the past year indicates deeper weakness in income growth and wages next year, which could weaken overall growth further. Industrial profits fell 8.8 percent year on year in August, the steepest drop since China's statistics agency began publishing such data in 2011. \nThe premier cited the emergence of new industries including the Internet sector, the continued need for high infrastructure investment in western regions, and ongoing urbanization as additional reasons for optimism on China's future growth trajectory. \nNonetheless, Li also highlighted the need for further market-oriented reforms and a reduced government role in the economy in order to fully grasp new economic opportunities and maintain growth. \n(Reporting by Nathaniel Taplin; Editing by Ed Davies)",

Learn more... \nSat, Oct 17, 2015, 10:11 BST - UK Markets closed China's Premier Li says achieving growth of around 7 percent 'not easy' Reuters – 8 minutes ago Print \nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Premier Li Keqiang said that with the global economic recovery losing steam, achieving domestic growth of around 7 percent is \"not easy\", according to a transcript of his remarks posted on the website of the State Council, China's cabinet. \nNonetheless in his comments, made at a recent meeting with senior provincial officials, the premier said that continued strength in the labour market and services were reasons for optimism, despite the headwinds facing the manufacturing sector. \n\"As long as employment remains adequate, the people's income grows, and the environment continuously improves, GDP a little higher or lower than 7 percent is acceptable,\" the premier said in the comments posted on Saturday. \nChina is due to release its third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth figures on Monday. A Reuters poll of 50 economists put expected growth at 6.8 percent year on year, which would be the slowest since the financial crisis in 2009. \nChina's growth in the first half of 2015, at 7 percent, was already the slowest since that time. Policymakers had previously forecast growth of \"around 7 percent\" for 2015. \nMost official and private estimates show that the Chinese labour market as a whole is outperforming the steep slowdown in industry, largely due to continuing strength in the service sector. \nBut some analysts have expressed concern that the sharp drop in industrial profits over the past year indicates deeper weakness in income growth and wages next year, which could weaken overall growth further. Industrial profits fell 8.8 percent year on year in August, the steepest drop since China's statistics agency began publishing such data in 2011. \nThe premier cited the emergence of new industries including the Internet sector, the continued need for high infrastructure investment in western regions, and ongoing urbanization as additional reasons for optimism on China's future growth trajectory. \nNonetheless, Li also highlighted the need for further market-oriented reforms and a reduced government role in the economy in order to fully grasp new economic opportunities and maintain growth. \n(Reporting by Nathaniel Taplin; Editing by Ed Davies)",

If there are no big political and economic emergencies worldwide, our preliminary expectations show foreign trade will be better in the fourth quarter than that in the third quarter,\" customs spokesperson Huang Songping told a news conference.\nRising labour costs and yuan appreciation hurt exporters' competitiveness in the first ninth months of the year, Huang added.\nBut a devaluation in the yuan in August was positive for China exporters, he said.

Glencore announced late last week it would suspend 500,000 tons of annual zinc output, triggering a 12-percent rally on Friday, the biggest ever one-day gain.\nWhile Naica represents a much smaller loss, the move illustrates the deepening pain for producers as they battle weak prices.\nPenoles said it had reached the decision after nine months of trying to clear enough water from the mine to reopen it, and that it was now in talks with the local miners' union to put an end to the collective work contract at the site.\nThe Naica move follows a series of other big mine closures earlier this year including MMG's huge Century zinc mine in Australia, and Ireland's Lisheen, owned by India's Vedanta.

I cannot continue to draw on taxpayers funds to keep the ovens operational when there is no realistic prospect that a buyer will be found. I am continuing my liquidation of the company, including talking with interested parties about purchasing the company’s other assets.” \nThe Government is holding a summit on Friday to discuss the crisis in the steel industry. \nBusiness Minister Anna Soubry said: “I had hoped that a commercial buyer for the coke ovens could be found but unfortunately this has not happened. This news is very, very disappointing and my thoughts are with the workers and their families. \n“The government will continue to focus on making sure we do whatever we can to help people.

It is the first time the court rejected the accounts of a head of state in nearly 80 years.\nAlthough the ruling is not legally binding it could be used by the opposition to build a case for Rousseff's impeachment in a Congress increasingly hostile to the unpopular leftist leader. Congress has the final word on Rousseff's accounts.\nOpposition lawmakers at the court clapped and hugged each other after the ruling, saying the decision was the beginning of the end for the Rousseff administration.\n\"The Rousseff administration is over.

The government started to repay those arrears this year and last week issued a decree that forbids any future delays.\nAttorney General Luis Adams said he will appeal the court decision with the Supreme Court.\n\"The game is not over yet,\" he told reporters after the ruling.

It could attempt to sell the bonds at a later date, the person said. The company’s press office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe cancellation marks a fresh blow to Petrobras, which is already suffering from a tumble in crude prices and a wide-ranging investigation into alleged kickback schemes. The Rio de Janeiro-based company’s shares have tumbled 63 percent in the past year and its bonds are trading at distressed levels.

For offshore investors, now doesn’t look like an appropriate time to have exposure to Petrobras bonds issued in local currency.\"\nThis month, the company cut its 2015 investment plan to $25 billion from $28 billion and slashed its forecast for 2016 expenditures by $8 billion. This year, the company reduced its production growth estimates by more than a third.\nFitch Ratings, which classifies Petrobras at the lowest level of investment grade, has said the company is one of the Brazilian issuers most vulnerable to the effects of a selloff in the local currency. This year’s slide in the real has made it the worst performer in emerging markets.\nOnce valued at $310 billion at its peak in 2008, making it the world’s fifth-largest company, Petrobras is currently worth $31 billion in the stock market.",

Domestic media has put the headcount reduction at 30 percent of its 600 staff.\nThe company, which does not regularly release China sales data, said in a release on Friday that it had sold 3,025 Model S cars in the country from January to September.\nMusk also said Tesla is already working with Chinese Internet company Baidu Inc on GPS navigation and automated driving.\nHe added that Tesla's giant $5 billion battery plant in Nevada, known as the \"gigafactory\" would produce its first batch of batteries next year, estimating that the plant would reach full capacity in two to three years.

Okuma Corp rose 6.5 percent and Minebea Co gained 6.0 percent, but still down 8 percent and 7.8 percent this year, respectively.\nExporters were also strong, with Toyota Motor Corp rising 0.9 percent and Honda Motor Co gaining 1.0 percent.\nAir-conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd rose 3.8 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that its overseas operations are picking up, with its Chinese business benefiting from brisk summer sales of commercial units for residential buildings. The stock was the third biggest positive contributor to the Nikkei, adding a hefty 11 points to the benchmark.\nHino Motors Ltd fell 2.4 percent after Credit Suisse lowered its rating to 'neutral' from 'outperform', citing weak demand in emerging markets and unfavourable exchange rates.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.2 percent to 1,496.03 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.2 percent to 13,405.00.

Okuma Corp rose 6.5 percent and Minebea Co gained 6.0 percent, but still down 8 percent and 7.8 percent this year, respectively.\nExporters were also strong, with Toyota Motor Corp rising 0.9 percent and Honda Motor Co gaining 1.0 percent.\nAir-conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd rose 3.8 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that its overseas operations are picking up, with its Chinese business benefiting from brisk summer sales of commercial units for residential buildings. The stock was the third biggest positive contributor to the Nikkei, adding a hefty 11 points to the benchmark.\nHino Motors Ltd fell 2.4 percent after Credit Suisse lowered its rating to 'neutral' from 'outperform', citing weak demand in emerging markets and unfavourable exchange rates.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.2 percent to 1,496.03 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.2 percent to 13,405.00.
