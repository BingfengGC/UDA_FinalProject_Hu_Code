European governments have resisted the idea as they negotiate with Athens on further bailout funds.\\n\"For Greece to succeed and for any program to fly, a significant debt restructuring should take place,\" Lagarde said.\\nIn wide-ranging comments, Lagarde said Ukraine appeared to be making progress in talks with private creditors to restructure its debts.\\nShe also said China\\'s policy efforts to fight a plunge in its stock market were unlikely to affect the IMF\\'s decision on whether to include the yuan currency in its special drawing rights basket of currencies.\\n\"Is that going to impact our assessment of the drawing rights basket? I don\\'t think so,\" she said. \"We will continue to do the work, and I don\\'t think we\\'ll be unduly derailed by some market variations that we\\'ve seen recently.\" (Reporting by Jason Lange and Michael Flaherty ; Editing by Susan Heavey and Dan Grebler)',\n",

Fixing the gash and sending it back could take weeks. \\nEnvironmentalists have criticised Shell\\'s drilling plans in the Arctic \\nShell spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh said the Fennica\\'s \"stay in Portland will be determined by the time it takes to make a safe, permanent repair\". \\nIt is likely the icebreaker will return to the Chukchi before the preliminary drilling reaches the oil zone, expected sometime in August. \\n\"Once we have determined the area is clear of sea ice, support vessels are in place, and the Polar Pioneer (rig) is safely anchored over the well site, drilling will begin,\" Ms op de Weegh said. \\nShell has spent about $7bn on Arctic exploration but has produced no oil nor gas. If it finds the region to be rich in economically recoverable oil, production would not begin for at least a decade. \\nEnvironmentalists have criticised Shell\\'s drilling plans in the Arctic, which is home to whales, walrus and polar bears .',\n",

Bank of America said it will implement any changes at the end of September.\\nThe decision pits investors who want the measure to better reflect the corporate high-yield market against those seeking higher yields associated with extra political risk. A removal of emerging-market companies, which accounted for 18 percent of the index at the end of March, may trigger price swings if bondholders are forced to sell those securities and raise funding costs for excluded companies.\\n“It may be detrimental if emerging-market companies were removed from the index because this could narrow the investor base,” said Ulrich Gerhard, a London-based fund manager at Insight Investment Management, which oversees about 397 billion pounds ($619 billion) of assets. “Once we see the outcome of the review we’ll decide whether we change the benchmark for the fund or if we need to change guidelines in terms of taking non-index positions.”\\nPetrobras Downgrade The portion of emerging-market companies in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global High Yield Index has swelled since they were first included four years ago.\\nPetroleo Brasileiro SA became the biggest index member after the Brazilian oil producer was cut to junk by Moody’s Investors Service in February, with $44 billion of debt, according to Bank of America.

U.S. companies make up 52 percent.\\nBank of America is considering removing emerging-market companies from sub-indexes such as the euro high-yield index, even if it keeps them in the global benchmark.\\n“It can be tricky when you have an index that suddenly has a big weight from countries like Brazil and Russia,” said Roman Gaiser, who oversees 3.5 billion euros of assets as the Geneva-based head of high yield at Pictet Asset Management SA. “In those countries, the sovereign risk overwhelmingly dominates the corporate risk.”',\n",
