M2 money supply rose 11.8 percent from a year earlier in June, the central bank data showed.\nIn other signs that growth is stabilizing, China\u2019s exports rose for the first time in four months in June and the nation\u2019s consumer-price index increased 1.4 percent from a year earlier, compared with the 1.2 percent increase in May.\nThe PBOC cut benchmark interest rates to record lows last month in the fourth reduction since November.\n\u201cFollowing the outright easing during the past half of year and given the already abundant short-term liquidity, we believe monetary easing may evolve into a new stage, focusing more on improving monetary transmission channels and directing more funding to the real economy,\u201d economists at UBS Group AG wrote in a note before the data release.","token_count":410,"prediction":1,"human_prediction":1},{"organizations":"[]","uuid":"4022d5833e2d6bf250ef1200d8bab41bb723b8b7","author":"Reuters","url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/09\/22\/itt-education-probe-doj-idUSL4N11S46820150922","ord_in_thread":0,"title":"ITT Educational's shares fall on DoJ probe","locations":"[]","highlightText":null,"language":"english","persons":"[]","text":"Sept 22 Shares of for-profit education provider ITT Educational Services Inc fell about 8 percent on Tuesday, a day after the company said it is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) under the False Claims Act.\nThe DoJ is investigating whether the company violated the Department of Education's Program Participation Agreement regulations by knowingly submitting false statements, ITT said in a filing on Monday.

IMF rules prohibit lending to a country unless public debt is considered to be on a sustainable path.

IMF rules prohibit lending to a country unless public debt is considered to be on a sustainable path. Greece has missed a payment to the IMF, and would also have to clear those arrears. \nBut the IMF official said that if European countries provided debt relief, Greece could recover. \n\"We have made it clear ... we need a concrete and ambitious solution to the debt problem,\" the official said. \"I don't think this is a gimmick or kicking the can down the road ...

Spain formally exited recession in 2013.","token_count":469,"prediction":1,"human_prediction":1},{"organizations":"[]","uuid":"e49fe956917dd1fbf25c63b227b24f88f48ab33e","author":"Reuters","url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/07\/16\/idUSASM000B1A20150716","ord_in_thread":0,"title":"BRIEF-Bionor Pharma agrees with Celgene on continued supply of romidepsin","locations":"[]","highlightText":null,"language":"english","persons":"[]","text":"July 16 Bionor Pharma ASA :\n* Enters into romidepsin supply agreement enabling advancement of its HIV therapeutic vaccine with Vacc-4x into full scale clinical Phase II\n* Says has signed an agreement with Celgene Corporation securing a continued supply of romidepsin (Istodax) Source text for Eikon:\nFurther company coverage: (Gdynia Newsroom)","external_links":"[]","published":"2015-07-16T09:41:00.000+03:00","crawled":"2015-07-16T08:52:58.000+03:00","highlightTitle":null,"thread_social_gplus_shares":0,"thread_social_pinterest_shares":0,"thread_social_vk_shares":0,"thread_social_linkedin_shares":0,"thread_social_facebook_likes":0,"thread_social_facebook_shares":0,"thread_social_facebook_comments":0,"thread_social_stumbledupon_shares":0,"thread_site_full":"www.reuters.com","thread_main_image":null,"thread_site_section":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/finance\/personal-finance","thread_section_title":"Wealth, Personal Finance &amp; Money | Reuters.com","thread_url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/07\/16\/idUSASM000B1A20150716","thread_country":"US","thread_title":"BRIEF-Bionor Pharma agrees with Celgene on continued supply of romidepsin","thread_performance_score":0,"thread_site":"reuters.com","thread_participants_count":1,"thread_title_full":"BRIEF-Bionor Pharma agrees with Celgene on continued supply of romidepsin | Reuters","thread_spam_score":0,"thread_site_type":"news","thread_published":"2015-07-16T09:41:00.000+03:00","thread_replies_count":0,"thread_uuid":"e49fe956917dd1fbf25c63b227b24f88f48ab33e","entities_persons":"[]","entities_locations":"[]","entities_organizations":"[]","word_count":62,"text_full":"BRIEF-Bionor Pharma agrees with Celgene on continued supply of romidepsin\nJuly 16 Bionor Pharma ASA :\n* Enters into romidepsin supply agreement enabling advancement of its HIV therapeutic vaccine with Vacc-4x into full scale clinical Phase II\n* Says has signed an agreement with Celgene Corporation securing a continued supply of romidepsin (Istodax) Source text for Eikon:\nFurther company coverage: (Gdynia Newsroom)","token_count":102,"prediction":1,"human_prediction":1},{"organizations":"[]","uuid":"c7f934bbe6719f0233ae8ed525627c79c6398cc0","author":"Felix Onuah","url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/08\/21\/nigeria-bonds-restructuring-idUSL5N10W2CW20150821","ord_in_thread":0,"title":"Nigeria restructures bank loans to cash-strapped states","locations":"[]","highlightText":null,"language":"english","persons":"[]","text":"ABUJA Aug 21 Nigeria has restructured short-term commercial bank loans to its cash-strapped state governments into longer-term sovereign bonds as Africa's biggest economy seeks to reduce a growing backlog of domestic debt against a background of falling oil revenues.\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) has issued bonds in respect of debts owed by 11 states to address \"fiscal imbalance\", its director-general Abraham Nwankwo said.

But residents as far south as Humacao, near the southwestern corner of the island, told Reuters they were without power.\nThe initial 147,000 without power represented about 4.3 percent of the island's roughly 3.5 million population.\nThe affected lines included a pair of 230-kilovolt lines, one linking the municipalities of Manati and Bayamon, in the north, the other between the Aguirre and Costa Sur power plants, in the south. The other two affected lines were 115-kilovolt transmissions, one linking Manati and Vega Baja, also in the north, and the other running between the major city Ponce and Santa Isabel, in the south.\nBayamon is close to San Juan, the island's capital city and business hub.

But residents as far south as Humacao, near the southwestern corner of the island, told Reuters they were without power.\nThe initial 147,000 without power represented about 4.3 percent of the island's roughly 3.5 million population.\nThe affected lines included a pair of 230-kilovolt lines, one linking the municipalities of Manati and Bayamon, in the north, the other between the Aguirre and Costa Sur power plants, in the south. The other two affected lines were 115-kilovolt transmissions, one linking Manati and Vega Baja, also in the north, and the other running between the major city Ponce and Santa Isabel, in the south.\nBayamon is close to San Juan, the island's capital city and business hub. Echevarria said he had no information as to whether business operations were significantly affected, but said PREPA had not heard serious complaints from businesses on the island.\nIn a statement, PREPA's deputy director, Carlos Castro, said PREPA was \"working on stabilizing\" its operations.\n\"We have incorporated reserve units and our staff is working on the problem,\" Castro said in the statement, translated from Spanish.\nPREPA has made news lately as it struggles with more than $8 billion in debt.

The London-listed group said it has raised the funds via the issue of 2.74bn shares priced at 0.19p each. \nIn a short statement released on Wednesday, the group said the funding will finance the acquisition of a 100% stake in the Thali project and will cover the payments of new regional developments in Namibia. \nLocated in the Rio Del Rey Basin, a sub-basin of the Niger Delta, the Thali block provides lower risk appraisal and exploration potential in this shallow water proven-producing region, the company said. \n\"The placing secures Tower's entry into the Thali block offshore Cameroon and provides the financial strength to commence our work programme on this block and across Tower's wider portfolio,\" said group chief executive Graeme Thomson. \n\"Our entry into the Thali Block is a shift in our risk profile from frontier to proven basins, which has been over eighteen months in the making.\" Tower shares were up 6.32% to 0.202p at 09:39 on Wednesday.","token_count":350,"prediction":1,"human_prediction":1},{"organizations":"[]","uuid":"7d3844ff9b5f6cf8732bf99ce5473c123684df1b","author":"Reuters","url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/09\/03\/markets-japan-stocks-foreigners-idUSL4N1192DK20150903","ord_in_thread":0,"title":"REFILE-Foreigners' net selling of Japan stocks hits record high last week on China worries","locations":"[]","highlightText":null,"language":"english","persons":"[]","text":"(Corrects syntax in paragraph 3)\n* Trust banks bought highest value of Japan stocks since March 2009\n* Foreigners sold highest value in cash Japan stocks since March 2014\nBy Ayai Tomisawa\nTOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Net selling of Japanese cash and futures stocks by foreign investors during last week hit a record high as buyers shunned riskier assets on worries that a China-led slowdown could hurt global growth.\nForeigners, who were also net sellers in the previous two weeks, sold a total of 707.05 billion yen ($5.89 billion) worth of Japanese cash stocks during the week of Aug. 24-28, the biggest weekly selling since March 2014, data released by the Japan Exchange Group on Thursday showed.\nForeigners sold a net 1.176 trillion yen in futures, taking the combined cash and futures net selling to 1.883 trillion yen, the highest ever, according to brokerages tracking the data.\n\"The figure shows that foreign investors were extremely risk-averse,\" said Seiichi Miura, an investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, adding that global investors grew more concerned that China's slowing demand could eat into production in advanced countries like Japan.\n\"If the market can confirm that profit growth is intact for Japanese companies at their mid-year earnings results in October, selling by foreigners will likely pause,\" Miura said.\nConcerns about China's economy pushed Japanese stocks sharply down, with the Nikkei share average falling more than 13 percent from its 18-1\/2 year high in late June and the broader Topix also dropping 13 percent from its eight-year peak last month.\nAlso keeping investors on edge is the prospects that the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise U.S. interest rates in the coming months.\nConversely, trust banks, which manage corporate pension trusts and national pension fund trusts, bought a net 263 billion yen in Japanese cash stocks, the highest since March 2009.\nTraders said when the Nikkei drops below the 18,000 level, its price-to-earnings ratio drops to around 14, making Japanese stocks attractive for pension funds which tend to hunt stocks at attractively priced levels.\nThe Nikkei ended 0.5 percent higher at 18,182.39 on Thursday.
