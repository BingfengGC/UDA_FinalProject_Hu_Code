The views expressed are his own. \nAug 19(Reuters) - There is a good chance today that one part of the Greek bailout saga will end with a relative whimper. \nThe parliaments of Germany and the Netherlands are expected to approve an 86 billion euro ($95.15 billion) bailout for Athens, the country's third. \nThere may be some tub-thumping, grandstanding and barely concealed fury about Greece's supposedly lackadaisical attitude to budgetary rigour. But it should get through, nonetheless. \nIn the short term, this will allow Greece to pay 3.2 billion euros to the European Central Bank tomorrow. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also removes the chance of Greece crashing out of the euro zone anytime soon. That was in no one's interest - hence the fact a deal did eventually get done. \nThere are, however, lots of loose ends. \nPolitically, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras lost about a third of his parliamentary party when the bailout came to a vote in the Athens legislature. This means he will ask for a vote of confidence. If he does not get it, he will call elections. \nIn and of itself, this should not affect the bailout - it is hard to image the no-bailout crowd winning outright power. But it will add uncertainty which is not particularly useful. \nThere also may be political fallout in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel may have to rely on lawmakers not of her party to get the bailout through. \nGreece's banks, meanwhile, remain in serious need of recapitalisation. That will come by the end of the year, but what the future shape of the Greek banking sector is, indeed how many banks there are and what will happen to all the bad loans, is up in the air. \nFinally, there is the International Monetary Fund.

Exports also declined, albeit to a lesser extent,\" the central bank said. The data showed the surplus widened to 2.09 billion euros from 1.86 billion euros in August 2014.

But they eventually bowed to pressure from TEPCO, which is struggling to find space to store tainted water. \n\"We have confirmed this underground water contains contaminants since it includes rainwater that has been exposed to rubble at the site.

He is currently being held at HM Prison Wandsworth. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise that Mr Hayes is appealing the sentence given its surprising length,\u201d Stephen Pollard, a London-based lawyer at WilmerHale, told Bloomberg . \n\u201cThe Court of Appeal may embrace the opportunity to clarify sentencing parameters for these kinds of cases because there are fewer.\u201d \nHayes was found guilty last month of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud, after a week of deliberations at the end of a two-month trial. \nThe Serious Fraud Office argued that the former derivatives broker at Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) and UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) was at the centre of a network of traders at 10 firms that conspired to manipulate the Libor benchmark between 2006 and 2010. \nMr Justice Cooke told London's Southwark Crown Court that the sentence was intended to send a message to the rest of the banking world. \n\"You played a leading role in the manipulation of Libor.

The 96-room hotel had filed bankruptcy earlier this year, listing a debt of nearly $1 million in room taxes to the Puerto Rico Tourism Co.\nPaulson's other tourism properties in Puerto Rico include the opulent Condado Vanderbilt, located near the San Juan Beach Hotel, the St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort and La Concha Resort.\nPaulson's investments in Puerto Rico are expected to total as much as $2 billion by the end of the year, according to the Department of Commerce and Economic Development. He called Puerto Rico the \"Singapore of the Caribbean\" last year at an investment summit.\nA spokesman for Paulson & Co. declined to comment.\nPuerto Rico is looking to tourism as one way to reinvigorate its ailing economy.

May was revised down slightly to 0.9 percent from 1.0 percent.\nSales at gasoline stations rose 2.6 percent, the fifth consecutive month of gains as prices at the pump climbed.

It\u2019s already running dry.\nWhere once-continued easy money would have been a recipe for rising stocks, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to end its zero interest rate policy last week sent stocks tumbling.\nIt\u2019s not just the Fed. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 2.75 percent the day after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled more stimulus. Meantime, the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.27 percent the day after the People\u2019s Bank of China delivered its fifth rate cut since November on Aug. 25.\n\u201cCentral bankers no longer enjoy the same power to reassure\u201d markets, Michala Marcussen, head of global economics at Societe Generale SA, said in a report to clients on Sunday.\nShe says investors are realizing that the policy makers are running out of the power to ease credit, weaken currencies and boost confidence seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ushered in an era of free money and quantitative easing.

The bank\u2019s total revenue declined after both net interest income and fee income fell.\nNordea said in August it will replace Clausen as CEO with Casper von Koskull, its head of wholesale banking, who takes over from Nov. 1."},{"organizations":[],"uuid":"437fdcf614fac6116c2cf9f0d36f8e0e69b27832","author":"Reuters","url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/09\/30\/idUSL5N1204Y720150930","ord_in_thread":0,"title":"BRIEF-Volkswagen says close to 700,000 cars affected by illegal software in Spain","locations":[],"highlightText":"","language":"english","persons":[],"text":"Sept 30 Volkswagen Ag\n* Says 683,626 cars in Spain are affected by the illegal software at the centre of the emissions scandal\n* Says 257,479 vehicles were sold under the Volkswagen brand, 221,783 under SEAT brand, 147,095 under Audi brand, 37,082 under Skoda brand and 20,187 under Volkswagen commercial brand.

It extended gains today, making mainland shares 48 percent more expensive."},{"organizations":[],"uuid":"433767e8e27ea673c41598948d0ee463e8706775","author":"Reuters - UK Focus","url":"https:\/\/uk.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/us-stocks-wal-mart-materials-204305994.html","ord_in_thread":0,"title":"US STOCKS-Wal-Mart, materials shares drag Wall St lower - Yahoo Finance UK","locations":[],"highlightText":"","language":"english","persons":[],"text":"RELATED QUOTES Symbol Price Change NWT.HA 44.65 -6.08 HD.SW 112.60 +7.20 UBGXF 0.00 FCX.SW 9.96 -0.86","external_links":[],"published":"2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00","crawled":"2015-09-24T02:16:19.969+03:00","highlightTitle":"","thread_social_gplus_shares":0,"thread_social_pinterest_shares":0,"thread_social_vk_shares":0,"thread_social_linkedin_shares":0,"thread_social_facebook_likes":0,"thread_social_facebook_shares":0,"thread_social_facebook_comments":0,"thread_social_stumbledupon_shares":0,"thread_site_full":"uk.finance.yahoo.com","thread_main_image":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/bt\/api\/res\/1.2\/M7vS95b2fvSzHFeFStPk0A--\/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztxPTc1O3c9NjAw\/http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/mit\/media\/m\/social\/images\/social_default_logo-1481777.png","thread_site_section":"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/rss\/headline?s=WMT","thread_section_title":"Yahoo!

The investors, who need at least 25 percent of a series of notes in order to demand their money right away in a process known as acceleration, are close to reaching that level for one of the bonds, the people said.\nOwl Creek first sought to form the group last year after starting its Argentina Recovery Fund in September. The effort initially gained little traction on concern it would protract a legal battle and derail chances of a quick settlement between Argentina and creditors from its 2001 default led by Elliott Management, whose lawsuit has blocked payments on restructured bonds since June 2014.\nPatrick Clifford, a spokesman for New York-based Owl Creek at Abernathy Macgregor Group, declined to comment on acceleration efforts. Dave Petrou, a spokesman for Jones Day, didn\u2019t return an e-mail and phone call seeking comment. A press official for Argentina\u2019s economy ministry declined to comment.\nIn an August presentation for its Argentina-focused fund, Owl Creek said accelerating the par bonds, which mature in 2038 and are the lowest-priced of the restructured bonds, could provide investors with a windfall profit in a subsequent bond swap.

Illinois this week entered its third month without a budget for the fiscal year that started July 1.\nHouse Speaker Michael Madigan told reporters after the vote that the bill was meant to buy labor peace by prohibiting strikes or lockouts.
